i agree with other reviewers that it feels good and does n't smell too much , however , i 've experimented with it several times to confirm my findings , and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads . i 'm 25 with an oily t-zone and very dry facial skin . on mornings after using this cream , i have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin . there are better products out there

this camera has a very poor lens . at 1x zoom , the barrel / spherical distortion is enormous ; try taking a picture of a tiled wall . image quality is also so-so when a picture is viewed at 100% ; scaled down on a computer monitor , the quality is ok . color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance .

this book offers more information about santa claus than it does the gods / godesses associated with the winter soltice . the craft projects are cheesey and the recipes terrible . save your money and do a little research yourself and if you want recipes or craft projects pick up one of those special christmas magazines for ideas you can adapt for a pagan holiday theme .

i have been a fan since valotte . and i like the other reviewers here , ca n't believe why this cd did n't receive the airplay it deserves ! there must have been some politics in there , with sean 's cd coming out on the same day ( yoko ? ) it is one of those cds that you just leave on and you do n't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you do n't like ! i love every song ! ! especially " day after day " , " i should have known " , " i do n't want to know " and my fav right now " cold " .. i hope that what i have heard is true that he is working on his latest now . ca n't wait ! buy this cd. . you wo n't regret it

worked fine for standard items . did not handle partnership issues completely . would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed ( maybe this is possible , but i did not find this function ) . in general , an easy , straightforward program that gets the job done

i have had this camera since jan ' 05 and have so far taken approximately 10 , 000 shots while on trips and at weddings . do n't expect much from it and you will be happy . as an entry level dslr it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions . i find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light , provided that they are not moving . cons : in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well . battery dies fast . the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting , especially when shooting in raw mode . i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode ( approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge ( over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day . i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike . so i always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . the viewfinder is very dim . when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d , it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d 's viewfinder . in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap , especially when having to resort to manual focus . autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible . when shooting indoors , the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject . i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur . this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus . the 420ex flash is supposed to " talk " to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed . however , with the 300d , this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over / under exposed . after about five months , the shutter button started sticking . i would click it and then it would remain depressed . the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little . another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button . and since there is only one thumbwheel , it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed . for example , if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature , then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel . when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera , this is a real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you are a casual point and shoot person , it 's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos . but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately , look elsewhere

the video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out . the tools are not explained and there is n't as much to do with it as they imply . may be nice for birthday party editing , i do n't know . i did n't like it . it 's not worth $100. the other capabilities might be nice , but from what i 've dealt with , that 's not the case

i have found another product that i want to recommend . it 's called alert and is sold by consultants like avon , but you can also go the starlight website and order it . it 's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters , and as a bonus i do n't feel hungry when i 'm using it . they also have a product specifically for weight loss . i have tried that as well . i did feel a bit jittery at first.. . but it settled after a week or so of taking it . i would recommend it also . i used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs . i did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss , but i credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings . i 'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need ... energy and hunger control and it 's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it . i 've used this for years and have not had any problems .

in theory , this camera is perfect . fits into your pocket . video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of mpeg-4. pictures are good if you know how to finesse it . perfect all around anytime camrea , right ? here 's the thing . i got the camera mainly for video . i just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that i could always have on me . also , i did not want minidv because uploading to the computer is real time . i wanted the sd card as film , even if it would sacrfice some video quality . but the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor / auotfocus nosie . on the playback i cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses . it sounds like someone smoking a hooka . and get this , it even says so in the instruction manual , page 35 , " caution during video clip playback , the sound of a motor is audible....during recording , the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded . this is not a malfunction . " awful . by the way , the take a picture while recording video function is worthless . it leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording , and the still image captured is usually blury . whats the point anyway , i think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video . or you can do it with whatever editing software you use . oh , and one last thing . i have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic . my hand shakes too much . there is a digital stabalization for the video , but no optical stabilization for the stills . its a big shame , too . the camera is very cool . if not for the audible motor noise , i would have given this at least an 8 / 10. but the lens motor noise is unacceptable ! ps . all cameras today should have a built in lens cover . this is one has a cheap plastic one , that you 'll probably lose

we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism . naturally , only time will tell if this is any different , but in the meantime , here 's what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket . much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i 've owned , thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere . the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n't need me to tell you this , right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it does not appear very clear , especially if the subject is not static . however , it is bright and rich in color . 3 ) infolithium - this is sony 's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately , of course . if use is consistent , will provide you with a good idea . if you use one function then another then another , it tends to vary much more and is not as useful . 4 ) integrated charger / usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer . minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger , though the bright white color is far from a match . the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it . i am not speaking about macros , but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small , near objects , such as coins , stamps , or text . quick focus on objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive , but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice . i do n't know if the battery is universal , but even if it is , it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony 's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard , but this camera uses the memorystick duo , which is about 1 / 4 or so smaller than the " regular " memorystick . this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless , as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny , thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark . within a few feet is okay , but farther subjects are not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures , meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate . you can certainly take pictures in bursts , but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick . previewing the images is also slow . this is also disappointing , as it 's not faster than my older p52. 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod , you have to mount the camera on the plastic station , then connect the tripod to the plastic dock . this is far from ideal . well , there you have it . the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you , in which case this could be a great value for you . i am certainly happy with it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards , compatibilities , and dubious long-term quality

the decalogue is one of several excellent tv series by european directors that puts us tv to shame . like bergman 's " scenes from a marriage " & " fanny & alexander , " von trier 's " the kingdom , " fassbinder 's " berlin alexanderplatz , " kusturica 's " underground , " and petersen 's " das boot , " the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers ' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run . unlike these other series , kieslowski 's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block ( and characters from one episode may pop up in another ) . the stories of the dekalog are morality plays , but they are not re-enactments of the ten commandments , but rather inspired by them , and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two . kieslowski & piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves ( instead of contracting 10 of poland 's best up & coming director 's to do each , as was initially planned ) , and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories . i wo n't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so , and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them , so i will comment on kieslowski 's style . kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature . his films often tackle issues of political import , however he intentionally avoids making " issue films , " but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected , as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture . his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before , during & after the solidarity movement . initially he started as a documentary film maker , but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects , he switched to his unique fictional style . this facets 3-disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available , in that the picture quality is a little better , however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series . first , facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu . to add to that , you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode , very annoying . then the picture quality is n't as good as it could be . not only is there evidence of flaws in the film ( scratches and blotches ) , but the film is n't a true digital copy of the original series , but rather a copy of someone 's pal tape of the broadcast , so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape . the picture is also cropped from the original , especially on the bottom . the picture at times jitters , especially during the ending credits . the english subtitles are minimal , at times missing dialogue , and can not be turned off . there are some nice extra features , particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists . however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog , and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub & use subtitles instead . apparently all of the other ( imported ) editions of the dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition , which is inexcusable given the price

certainly this album offers very little to a fan of the ocean blue 's eariler work . the vocals and guitars sound quite different ( gone is that beautiful dreamy sound ) . and what about those awesome saxaphone and keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun ? just because steve lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether . so , anyway , what does this album offer instead ? harder sounding guitar , angrier sounding vocals , and songs that are somewhat intersting , but are lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after you 've had the cd for a couple weeks . exceptions : & quot ; whenever you 're around&quot ; , and & quot ; slide&quot ; are good enough songs to standout inspite of boring production

when one begins to despair about the quality ( or lack thereof ) of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being . not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over 240 pages one that i finished all too quickly . i could not get enough of it . the narrator and main character of the novel is a mr. stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly . his employer , a lord darlington , is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the germans . and what did mr. stevens think of this ? he did n't , he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate . there is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in mr. stevens . you 'll have to read the book if you want to know more . i read mainly victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not . if you get this book you will not be sorry .

this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths , and underlying the story are indeed echoes , sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted , of ancient myths . god is allegorized as gabalawi , the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs . the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters . the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel ; the second that of moses and pharaoh ; the third that of jesus ; the fourth that of muhammad . then there is a fifth story , in which the central figure , a ` magician ' , is presumably a scientist . he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it , but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi ` who had been easier to kill than to see' . it makes no difference : the scientist , who has invented a weapon of great destructive power , is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer , and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever , though they remain hopeful that one day ` magic ' will put an end to their suffering . subtle the book is not , either in content or in style ; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive . the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names , but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another . a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent . they mostly ` shout ' , ` scream ' , ` shriek ' , ` yell ' , ` cry ' or ` sneer ' , which becomes rather tiresome . the literary quality of this novel is , i think , greatly inferior to mahfouz 's rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature . but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written : it has been banned in egypt ; its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author 's life .

collateral damage is the great and partially real action film in which arnold schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall . with the attacks on sept 11 , movies have tried to cash in but collateral damage is different . arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview with byron allen . the movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks , but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks . basically , the fbi and cia tell gorden brewer ( arnold schwarzennger ) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family , when in fact they have no good leads on the suspect . rather , than sitting on his butt , and waiting for the fbi to do something , gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family by going into columbia and getting ' 'the wolf' ' ( cliff curtis ) as the terrorist is called . there is a great scene in which gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their ' 'collateral damage'' . the radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims . i loved this scene , because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead . he probably has no family of his own , and does n't know the meaning of life , except to cover his own . now you might say to yourself what 's the difference between arnold 's character ( who is going for justice ) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from arnold himself : ' 'the difference between me and you is that i am only going to kill you'' . unbelievable action and twists at the end , that you 're literally be on the edge of youre seat , and just when you think the movie is over... . it 's not ! ! ! director andrew davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on columbia , but also a factual based type movie that deals with terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this do n't happen again . in fact , most people will remember the horrible case of wall street reporter , daniel pearl , who was executed after the u.s. failed to meet the demands of the middle east terrorist holding . the u.s. should have gone after these terrorists like the way arnold does in this movie . but then the u.s. does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970 's the u.s. supported and backed up madmen like general pinochet in chile and dictator samoza in nicaragua . both of them killed hundreds of people with u.s. backing and funding . still though ' 'collateral damage' ' is a great action film that you must see .

while " scary movie 4 " does work in getting out a couple of laughs , it certainly does not live up to the past three . many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly , are getting pretty old . although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as the grudge , saw , and war of the worlds , it misses the funny mark just by a bit . personally , i felt they could have done a lot more in terms of parodying these films , particularily with the grudge . the writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier . and really , was it necessary to spoof films such as brokeback mountain and millionaire dollar baby , both of which are not horror films ? i believe the comedy in this film is aimed towards a more mature audience , and is vastly different from what scary movies 1 & 2 offered ( which i found to be extremely hilarious ) . if you 're looking for over the top funny , look towards the other scary movies

i generally like elmore leonard , this is the twelfth book of his i 've read , ranging from his detroit crime capers , to his l.a.-set chili palmer stuff , to some of his westerns . other than the terrible " be cool " , this is probably my least favorite of his books so far . set in the years between the end of world war i and 1934 , the story follows carlos " carl " webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot u.s. marshall . the story takes place in the dusty midwest , mainly around tulsa and oklahoma city , as carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves . carl is a somewhat vain , cocky lawman , with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers . his main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man , a no account young man who has everything he needs , but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into carl 's path . mixed into this are kinds of period details , from prohibition to will rogers shows to klansmen vigilantes to " true detective " writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers pretty boy floyd , john dillinger , and bonnie and clyde barrow . despite all this background detail , the story itself failed to engage me . there are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize leonard 's best work . there 's a good guy , a bad guy , and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic . in fact , about halfway through the book i realized that the " real story " was n't going to kick in - - i was in it ! and unlike many leonard books , the supporting cast of characters is n't particularly memorable . even leonard 's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing , subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech . ultimately , one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period , and perhaps did n't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story . that said , the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story , given the time and place . all in all , unless you 're really really into the whole ' 30s gangster thing , not worth the time .

i am a br5-49 aficionado from the early days at robert 's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks . admittedly , i long for those days as much as i long for stirrups in major league baseball . so i 'm nostalgic , " it 's a free country . " it is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels . yet , whenever i read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has " matured , " i can do nothing but cringe . here 's the flowchart : band starts out - band plays hard - band gets cult following - band gets reputation - band strikes out on road - band gets contract - band gets a little more pub . - band gets contract with bigger label - band gets new management supplied by label - band gets " coached " in next recording - band changes faces along the way - band changes label again - band gets new direction from new label - band fights for identity - band produces new " mature " album - band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process . gee , i sure hope this is n't how the end of br5-49 comes about , but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion . this record is ok . of course , i realize that any band ca n't just re-hash the same ' ol stuff on every album , but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl . one part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals , and a simple taste of this is what i sorely miss in the last few recordings . this band live used to be a wild , jittery , moving organism on stage , and although they are still a solid live show ( saw them on the last tour at poor david 's pub in dallas ) , something has settled down . chuck is a great talent , but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of chuck and gary bennett . ok , i 'll go cry me a river , but dammit , just go listen to the big backyard beat show one more time . mature ? i just do n't want to grow up that bad

there is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from how to cook without a book : recipes and techniques every cook should know by heart , by pam anderson ( not the big-breasted one ) , and that is the art of the highly marketable title . for starters , this artful moniker really plays on the single gal 's fears about never being able to put together nutritious , attractive , varied , affordable , and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week . you want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world . so the plus side of this book is the title . that 's where it ends . the big idea here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook by : a ) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation , and b ) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques . sounds interesting so far , right ? well , the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on " canned low-sodium chicken broth " , which i think is a bit of a weird ingredient . it 's even included in the salad dressings . other big hitters include : heavy cream , butter , and sour cream . do people really eat like this ? regularly ? why not make the easy fruit parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal ? just take a tall glass , drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream , then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar , and some berries . repeat until the glass is filled . crikey . sour cream , brown sugar , and berries ? ! ? would n't it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of greek honey ? am i totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing ? or , if calories are no object anyway , why not pick up some baskin robbins ' rocky road on the way home from work ? that 's easy and it 's worth the internal havoc it will cause . oh , and here 's a sample mnemonic device that i ca n't not share , it 's that good : " cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil , then toss in some pasta that 's fresh from the boil . " pure genius , right ? right . in a way , the author was right - i can cook all these things without a book . but why would i want to

it 's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer . yeah , maybe my fish can get a record deal : they " sing " in tone , can breath , but refue to lip-synch ( i know it sounds gay ) . this is just sad because bands that play their own instruments , write their own songs , and perform their own songs can pretty much get almost no attention . let 's take the band king 's x : doug pinnick ( vocals / bass ) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about god ( king 's x is a christian band ) ; ty tabor ( guitar / vocals ) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably do n't know ; and jerry gaskill ( drums / vocals ) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns...yet only like a few dozen people ( i know a lot more people than that like kx ; i 'm just exagerating ) seem to like this band . it 's sad . if you want good music , listen to the band i just menioned ( king 's x if you were n't paying attention ) .

watching the melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining . they began as an unassuming punk band , and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70 's rock into their sound . then they stripped away any and all of the " punk " trappings and went for pure heavy . it all culminated with this record . it just does n't get any heavier than ' roman bird dog / hung bunny' . ' with teeth ' , rumored to actually be written by joe preston , is one of my all time favorite melvins songs . speaking of joe preston , he was the by far best of the melvins ' 7000+ bassists they had over the years . shame they got rid of him shortly after this album . as soon as they fired him , they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity hell . bad karma . thank god that rock bands record their music so that it is n't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions . the only song on this record which i do n't like is the cover of alice cooper 's ' the ballad of dwight fry' . thankfully they made up for it with a cover of flipper 's ' sacrifice' . some of the melvins ' subsequent records have their moments ( stoner witch 's ' shevil ' , stag 's ' cotton mouth ' ) , but for the most part it seems to me that the melvins gave up the ghost after recording this . maybe someday they 'll make a comeback

dr. hawkins first book , power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology . however , he began to venture into misapplication of this method , and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity , concept , or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement . there are serious logical , philosophical , and practical flaws in his work , and his attempt to quantify matters that are n't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests . this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques . the actual technique is worthwhile , but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid . the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate , valid answers . hawkins explores issues about media , politics , religion , spirituality , history , philosophies , healing arts , entertainment , and more , and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters . he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters , liars , and two-faced sociopaths . he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists , many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and do n't resort to hawkins ' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth . hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method , as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology , but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod . i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful , responsible work in those areas . for now i 'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job , many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds , and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world

having used the office programs for some time , i was a bit put off by the new ribbons which replace the old menus . i guess that office needed a new look , but i am not sure if i buy the advertising that the ribbon will make my work more productive . some things that you should know about office 2007 and ultimate in general . the licensing agreement allows you to install office 2007 ultimate on two computers , one of them being a laptop . i found this clause in the legal agreement and even called microsoft legal to confirm . if you make modifications to the quick access toolbar ( and who wo n't do that ? ) and you want to take these changes with you to another computer , the files for the toolbars are located at : c: \documents and settings\username\local settings\application data\microsoft\office where username is your username . something i have found handy when working with my two computers . one thing that i do n't like is that the file name extensions have changed . gone is the familiar .doc for word documents . now the file extension is .docx . if you want to create a document that can still be opened by prior versions of word , you must purposefully choose to create a .doc file , but you lose some of the functionality of the new files . the .docx file this format is not the same as the opendocument standard . microsoft promises that older versions of word can still open the .docx files , but i have not tried it and i do n't buy into everything that microsoft promises until i see it happen . why could n't microsoft just leave the files the same as they have always been ? office 2007 does look slick and i anticipate that i will warm up to it in the future as i get used to the new command structure .

i read the review centering on the box the dvd comes in and must admit that i was stumped as well . it was " different " but i do n't foresee this as being a problem overall . the new office ultimate 2007 loaded quickly . how quickly ? well , i had to check my new vista hp notebook because i could n't believe that it packed all of the programs onto the system in such a short amount of time . it asked for the product key and one or two other bits of data but that was it . out of all the office suites i have owned , this one loaded so quickly i was sure there was a problem . nope . access , outlook , word , powerpoint , publisher , onenote , excel , groove and a host of others were there ready to be activated ( do n't worry ; you only do it once , not for each separate program . naturally , if you are like me and totally dependent upon email , you 'll activate outlook first ) . the new office " feels " different . the ribbons are ok but i would suggest that they allow us the option to retain the classic ( xp ) view . i rely quite a bit on the research task pane and i do n't mind telling you that it was difficult to find . the menu bar is a bit on the thin side and having so many icons on the top added clutter and confusion , at least for me . of course , finding the research task pane could have been quickly resolved if microsoft had put a product manual in the box ( yes , the online help is nifty but sometimes a man just needs to read about it from a manual instead of printing it out ) . all in all you will find all of your old favorites . and , true to the office legacy , they really have not changed enough to warrant a major release but i 'm willing to bet that after all is said and done , office ultimatae 2007 will become the industry standard

this is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish . there are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber . i have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it . i use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography . the quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release . i bought an extra quick release plate so i can switch between two cameras . tilt only - - no swivel : amazon ( and others including bogen ) calls it a swivel tilt head , but that seems to imply that it moves in two directions - - tilting ( up and down ) and swivelling ( side to side or panning ) . this head only moves in the tilting direction which allows you to orient the camera in either landscape or portrait modes . the tilting action could be improved if the head clicked into the upright position when you tilt it back to landscape . when you are going to the portrait mode , there 's no problem since it stops at 90 degrees . however , when i want to go back to landscape , i have to hold it out and look at it to see if it 's level . a subtle click to know i 'm there would be nice

presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a prince album or two but do n't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection . the way this is laid out though is confusing at best : disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable . ( " my name is prince " ? his take on " nothing compares 2 u " when sinead o'connor 's is definitive ? ) disc 2 compiles 12 " mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e . for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat his purpleness every records . bottom line : this is haphazardly thrown together . middle range fans are better off with the hits / the b-sides which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material ( some of which equals his singles )

the lawsuit mentioned in mr john matlock " gunny " review has nothing to do with the quality or legality of documents created using quicken willmaker plus software . instead , it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license . he used will-making software ( not quicken willmaker plus ) to write a will for an elderly client . the trouble arose because he created the will outside of her presence and arranged for her to sign it while she was hospitalized . apparently she never reviewed the will . in other words , he acted too much like a lawyer . while the " unauthorized practice of law " is a vague concept , had the insurance agent merely recorded the woman 's wishes and entered them verbatim into the software , there would almost certainly have been no problem . there is no problem with using software to prepare a will for your self . nor is there a problem with using it to create a will for someone else if you merely type in that person 's answers at their direction . the main way to run afoul of unauthorized-practice-of-law rules is to give legal advice to or prepare documents for others without their express , detailed instructions .

i think india is one of the most talented artists today . her voice is sensational . sadly , as with many great artists today , this album feels more producer / market-driven rather than artist-driven . i understand that regaetton is popular right now . i would even understand including a few reggaeton-flavored songs to " keep up with the times " ( shakira 's " la tortura " comes to mind ) . but who mixes two genres within a single song ? ! ? " soy differente " flows perfectly as a salsa , until regaetton beats come in . the style feels very out-of-place in this song , as in most other songs in this album . maybe this kind of thing will work at a club , but not for extended listening . in my opinion , the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling india 's own style . i hope she will regain contol by the next album

first of all , let me say this product is great in almost every way . so if you need to feel better about your nose and / or throat , go for it . my main complain about the grossan hydro pulse is that it is noticeably expensive . some time ago , grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the hydro pulse . but then , grossan decided to produce his own machine and , if i 'm right , viajet is making it for him . viajet sells the same machine , except for the grossan tip , at about -again - a half the price of the hydro pulse . the breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive ( i have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country ) . so what makes the hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health is a business , after all . other than that , like i have said , this product is great for almost any respiratory problem . i used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle , and is intended to use it over 50 times . the hydro pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime , so you get the idea . also , if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment , look for the buteyko method

i 'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about ( sounds like someone with an axe to grind ) but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship . the music is inspired , the melodies transcending , and the emotion - deep and meaningful . as far as " copying yanni " goes , well - i do n't agree , in fact , yanni is far more generic and less inspired . the sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact not the same nor , are they yanni 's creation . i write this review to commend mr farish on his work , and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and could n't resist his own urge to see his " critique " in print . ryans music is distinctly his own , no question - and any similarities are tonal , and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of . as far as i 'm concerned , you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve 's and websites for music to criticize - and well , make themselves feel a little better . personally , i would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy . all the other stuff is for hacks ! enjoy this music ! i do .

by chance before picking this up i had just finished the heart is a lonely hunter by carson mccullers , and was struck by the similarities and differences . it 's a great " compare and contrast " pair , as an exercise for high-schoolers . both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary . heart published in 1940 , and castle in 1948 , both about life in the 30s . both families are poor . in castle though , there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs . this is supposedly because they " do n't know how to do anything " . so instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter . how charming ! they are " eccentric " , which seems enough in the author 's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves . only stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper , enamored of cassandra , does work and gives the family his entire salary . but he is of the class that is expected to toil after all . even he is rewarded in the end- -able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum topaz- -striking poses . unlike the looming and grinding poverty of heart then , the poverty in the castle never amounts to more than a lark- -educated folks playing at being poor until they 're rescued by romantic circumstance . not so in america where mick kelly , who did n't know how to do anything either , went off to work at woolworth 's , and to a life of little hope . in castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina , the inheritance . two dashing young wealthy americans one of whom has inherited the castle , show up just in time , with their chatty modern mum . they throw money around and talk too much , in the cliched extravagant american style . most of the remainder of the novel consists of cassandra and her sister rose swooning over one brother or the other , with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being . it 's all so very charming , bourgeois , and harmless . if your life is hard do n't worry- -a man will show up to rescue you ! the reviews for this novel in amazon are overwhelmingly positive . smith was obviously talented . her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read . i wish she had given cassandra a little more ambition .

i grew up reading harold evan 's sunday times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could . i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem ; ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome ( i 'm irish ) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland . however , from today 's perspective , the paper 's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as ` what would the world do without henry kissinger ? ' [indeed this has always seemed to be mr. kissinger 's view also] ; and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance , compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation . my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan . a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles ( ss-20s ? ) being deployed in russian forests . i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002 / 3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of saddam 's mobile chemical / biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist . in saying all the above , i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch . the book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made evan 's sunday times great - the investigative reports from the insight team and others , of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry ( thalidomide ) and the aircraft industry ( mcdonnell douglas ) ; the publication of the crossman diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet . having established his credentials as a ` vertical ' journalist - evan 's term , which he describes as ` seeking to get to the bottom of things ' - and lauding his proprietors , the thomson 's , for allowing him to do so , the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr. murdoch as owner . the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating , the thomson 's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity , and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors . murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times , having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of ` national directors ' , guarantees , which if breached , were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction . as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times - one of the free worlds most revered titles . in his description of the paper , evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment - he sees it as the paper of record , upholding fair , non-partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect . one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people 's educational background , almost every colleague is named and then his / her school and university are listed - for example joe smith , winchester , oxford , to establish both social class and academic ( perhaps intellectual ) credentials . he documents the ` four pillars ' of the times as its reporting of parliament , its legal coverage , its obituaries and its leader columns . oh dear ! stolid stuff , from the fearless , vertical , investigative editor . nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan 's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which , by implication , criticise his predecessor as editor ( william rees mogg ) ; and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution . looming behind this story is murdoch 's general management style - haphazard interventions , secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning . from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions , rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans . the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth - murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors . the text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone , save perhaps murdoch , evan 's second-in-command betrays him , various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys , the ` national directors ' turn out to be paper tigers ( this is too good a pun to delete ) , the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken , piecemeal . the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero , valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious , double-dealing murdoch , whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval . however , by the time i got to this section i had , sadly , lost a lot of respect for evan 's impartiality , his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities . this was reaffirmed in my mind when , on the day that evan 's agreed to reign , who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger ! in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor , initially at least , popular . evans , though personally engaging - and i 'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs . the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates ; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union . the fading , indeed failing , social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly , given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides . i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change . the rest of the story - evans attractive forthrightness , murdoch 's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story , are ultimately a side show . this book is well told , highly dramatic and engaging , however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done .

i was introduced to the matthew shepard story by mtv 's dramatic presentation of matthew 's last days in laramie . with that as my background , i entered the laramie project with curiosity regarding the reactions of laramie 's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention . matthew was a human being , undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death . shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several laramie residents , but not everyone shared that view . that fact was refreshing . the law enforcement officer who freed matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic . her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed , but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent . other laramie residents were just as horrified . the so-called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected , but equally unnerving . this film , though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed , has the feel of a documentary . knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times . but the presentation was enlightening . the film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that - crimes . no matter what a person 's viewpoint , lifestyle or background , no one has a right to take on the position of punisher . humans are not animals . or , at least they should n't act like them . the laramie project exposes the heart of many people after the matthew shepard murder . it is worth the watch

i 'm a horn performance major , and i bought this box set because i needed recordings of all of beethoven 's symphonies but at a low cost . now first off , yes , they sound great . however , i 've noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony : karajan changes beethoven 's orchestration ! allow me to explain : the horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns - - instruments bound to the overtone series . on the " natural " or " hand " horn , pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment ( like a bugle ) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell . this technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches , however , the " stopped " notes have an entirely different tone color ; most composers favored " open " pitches , especially for symphonic works . in the exposition , the second theme is announced by a call in e-flat by the horns . however , in the recap , the same call must be in the tonic ( c ) , as dictated by sonata form . the horn part is written for e-flat horns , which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised e-flat major , the relative major . the e-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment - - they are all " open " notes . however , in the recapitulation , the c call would include two " closed " notes if it were played by the e-flat horn . the horns could change crooks and become c horns , in which case the call would again be all open partials , but beethoven does not do this ; i am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in e-flat for the transition , leaving them no time to change , or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement . for whatever reason , beethoven left the horns in e-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again , which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound , beethoven moved the call to the bassoons . in karajan 's recording , the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation . granted , if beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns , he might have written both calls in the horn section . there is no way to prove for certain that this is the case , however . it strikes me as very arrogant to " correct " beethoven 's instrumentation , and i feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master 's writing is a more prudent performance choice .

my boyfriend bought from the earth to the moon , and since he is an astrophysics student i expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people 's conceptions about going to the moon at that early time . he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things did n't make much sense . well , from a layman 's perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging . it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic , physics and astronomy . even from my scientifically deprived perspective , a lot of things in the book did n't make much sense , such as the actual method of getting to the moon , but this does n't really take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal . the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous . i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work , and what these poor souls were going to come up with next . compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however , from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative . verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality , and much unlike his other works , does n't stray far from the earthly . some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion , but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read . if you drop at the sight of f ( x ) = y , then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking , centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate . if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today . if you , like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then from the earth to the moon is definitely worth your time .

old spice is a great-smelling cologne and i 've worn it for years . my dad wore it when i was growing up and i remember he almost always smelled of it . it 's a great cologne for lean , athletic guys who love retro ; it 's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men . it takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff . the smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention , otherwise he 'll just be annoying . old spice cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time ; exposing it to heat helps to age it ( leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building ) . trust me , it smells awesome if you let it age . i meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle . i 'm proud to say i 'm carrying on the tradition of wearing old spice cologne . it 's not nerdy and it 's not just for older men . it 's a cologne for any masculine guy . it smells great

i ca n't believe none of the other reviews of the ultra lounge series state that these cd 's contain almost all instrumental music , with very few songs that feature vocals . i expect a lounge music cd to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks , and of the four ultra lounge cd 's i purchased , i count only three songs with vocals on all four of them . while the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music , they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them . the titles of the ultra lounge cd 's ( such as bachelor pad or bossanova ) mean very little , as each cd fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks . the best lounge cd i have heard so far is from an unlikely source . i purchased it at pottery barn , and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs . keep this in mind when buying lounge music cd 's so that you wo n't be disappointed the way i was with the ultra lounge series

those who condemn this book for not being a long , boring list of name origins and meanings , or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today 's children , are missing the point . " baby names now " is a fun , readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s , including famous namesakes ( saints , popes , presidents , royalty , music and movie stars ) and what some celebrities have named their children . it 's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style : for example " lisa , " " amy , " " susan " and " dawn " were very popular for babies born in the 60s ( and thus , my classmates ) , but are rarely used today . the book 's major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire , not just the first names . at one point , it reads " harrison ford...is almost certainly the reason for the name harrison 's popularity " - excuse me , ever hear of the beatles ? the entries for the name " jordan " do n't mention michael jordan , certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area . the entry for " jackson " does n't mention michael , janet , or samuel l . the entry for " landon " does n't mention michael . the entries for " cassidy " do n't mention david and shaun , so popular in the 70s when many of today 's moms were growing up . the entry for " lucas " - do i have to say it , fellow star wars kids grown up and naming their children ? and come on , how can you mention the name " wayne " without acknowledging the popularity of john wayne ? still , this is a lot of fun , and i give the authors credit for recognizing that " althea " is from a grateful dead song . i look forward to the next edition

the first epilator that i used was the epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80's . i did not use this for long... . a tool of complete torture ! i finally got brave enough to give epilators a try again and got one from " veet " which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job that i was completely hooked on using an epilator . good-bye razors and wax ! i figured that if a single roller did a good job that the conair which had two rollers would do even better . the conair does a good job and i 'm keeping it as my spare , but the epilator from veet actually does a better job . i no longer have any discomfort from the epilators and i even do my bikini area and underarms . i love the results on my underarms and the money saved on waxing . once you see and feel the results you will be completely won over . update : i 've had more time to use the conair epilator and now i 've actually been using it more than my " veet " . just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will be very happy with it . as a matter of fact i am ordering one as a gift for one of my friends

i 'll get to the plot of " the gang 's all here " in a minute , because the plot is n't the most memorable part of this movie . the most memorable part is the bananas . about 20 minutes into the movie , a towering hat of technicolor fruitappears on the screen , followed by its owner- - " brazilian bombshell " carmen miranda . she proceeds to do a number called " the lady in the tutti-frutti hat , " accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas . six-foot-tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number 's end , when the chorus girls , worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit , lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island . there 's a reason this number occurs so early on : it takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie . but then , this is busby berkeley , a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war . and next to kitsch , war is pretty much the motivator here . the wafer-thin story involves andy ( james ellison ) , a soldier who woos and wins edie ( alice faye ) , a canteen dancer , the nightbefore andy goes off to world war two . in what seems an instant , andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of andy 's childhood sweetheart and fiancee- -who , unfortunately for edie , is not edie . will the heartbreak be resolved ? do you really care ? the plot is mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major ' 40s stars ( in particular , eugene pallette and edward everett horton are hilarious ) , and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop out of thin air . ( in a couple of scenes , benny goodman and his orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of it . ) " the gang 's all here " is really a 1943 time capsule , but an eye-popping rouser of one . they do n't make ' em like this anymore . they did n't make ' em much like this back then , either

i bought an epilator because i was tired of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me . i 've had my epilator for several weeks now and i am already seeing amazing results ! i used it for the first time on my legs . i 'm not going to lie...it was painful . i just made sure to go slowly , pausing every few inches , and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as i could get it . eventually , i was able to get most of the thick , dark hairs off of my legs . **please know that the epilator is not an immediate " cure-all " . hair grows in stages , so as soon as you get rid of some hairs , several more grow in behind them . ( eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them , but it will take some time . ) because of this , it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week . since it 's winter , i just let it all grow out so that the epilator can get more hairs . however , when new hair grows in , i am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown . it does n't hurt nearly as much to pull those out ! i also know that i 'll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter . my legs are smoother and i do n't get razor burn ! right after epilating , sometimes i do experience a little irritation but , unlike razor burn , it goes away after just a short time . another neat thing is that , unlike waxing , the epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs . this gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth ! i used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed . now , i get smoother skin just about whenever i want to ! i was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product i had not heard much about . with the exception of the few reviews i read online , i was pretty much in the dark . i went ahead and went for it , then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks ! not only have i epilated my legs , i have also used it under my arms , on my upper lip , and on my bikini line . the results have been better than i could have imagined ! ! again , i 'm not going to lie...ouch ! ! ! ! ! epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days ( i have very thick hairs ) . however , i got the majority of the hairs and after the first time , i realized that i 'm never going to have to shave again ! yes , some little blonde hairs grow back , but they are all thinner and much less painful . in fact , sometimes it tickles a little . :o ) i epilate there once to twice a week ( about a five minute job if you 're being careful , two if you 're in a hurry ) and i have smoother underarms ! i used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month . now i just epilate . it hurts , but just for a second . plus , i keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax , i only need to pull 5-10 each time . **a word of caution : our skin is more sensitive in some areas , so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line , be careful . i managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating " blade " . now i just make sure that i do n't leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds . if i miss some hairs , i come back another time to get them . this epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs ( i 've only had a few and the pad fixes them ) and a little cleaning brush . the epilator is very easy to clean . the top ( dark purple section ) pops off and you run it under hot water . when it dries , you put it back on . **note , the epilator does not store hairs inside of it . when they are pulled out , they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator ( i stop periodically to wipe them off ) or they go flying . i sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs . i hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator . i am very satisfied with this product and i recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time . **are the few minutes of pain worth it ? ? ? absolutely ! :o )

darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games . to make a commercial-quality game in this language would be lunacy , basic just is n't quite flexible enough to do that with ease , and the darkbasic renderer looks very , very ugly . however , basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with . if you 're trying to get into serious game development , learn c++ and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx , or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source . and make sure you 've learned a good deal of physics and math

i love " fool for the city " i have also always loved savoy brown " looking in " and did n't know until recently that lonesome dave was the singer and most of the savoy brown band went on to form foghat . if you are a foghat fan you should check out " looking in " by savoy brown . if you 've heard other stuff by savoy brown and did n't like it , do n't be discouraged because " looking in " ( and only " looking in " ) is essentially foghat . there were a lot of changes in savoy brown personnel through the years and the guys that did looking in were the best .

with so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie , but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down . matthew mcconaughey delivers another good performance , yet does n't stray too far from what he knows best . there is bradley cooper as his best friend who you will remember as rachel mcadams fiance in wedding crashers . patton oswalt appears in a blink and you 'll miss him scene , but the heros of the day are kathy bates and zooey deschanel who 's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play . bates is great as mcconaughey 's mother while zooey is at her sarcastic best as parker 's flatmate . parker should stick to television , she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role , maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie . a good date movie flick , the story is predictable but i would have been willing to look past that had i been entertained . special features are nothing too special . a trailer and a few dodgy featurette's . a rainy night rental movie

if you 're reading this . you want to upgrade , your old computer to windows xp professional edition here are a few things to keep in mind . first thing is , you can download service pack two from windows update . so no need to buy it integrated with xp . these are what i consider the minimum system requirements : 256 mb of ram . i have found is adequate more equals better . 500 mhz or higher will do . 7200 rpm hard drive will help a lot . if you 're running windows millennium edition , or 98 upgrade now the stability is vastly improved . gone are the blue screens of death . frequently asked question : is windows xp pro better than home edition ? windows xp pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing . so for most users windows home edition is fine . they both are based on the same code and are almost identical . if you 're thinking of upgrading from windows 2000 , i did , because i like the gui interface better . but windows xp is as stable as windows 2000. so it 's your call . the plug-and-play ability of windows xp is totally great ! windows xp will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards , network cards , etc. that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for cds with drivers . i recommend upgrading to windows xp be a professional or home edition . it is a great operating system have some fun and get it done

i was intrigued by his & quot ; the end of history . &quot ; i thought his & quot ; trust&quot ; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation . i only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of good books . in the end , & quot ; the great disruption&quot ; is a down right silly book . it has a lot of usefull data but fukuyama 's humanistic ideology clouds it all . all his empirical data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion : that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good . fukuyama proves that the moral consensus - - the social capital - - of the earlier era has been wiped away . that crime has sky-rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men . then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital . he does n't bother to deal with societies - - like ethiopia - - that have never been able to build up enough social capital . he does n't really look any further back in history past about 1950. his generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history . he thinks ( based on his ideology of human goodness ) that things just have to get better . if he had studied pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history , he would know better . people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long-term historical cycles . for that , i would recommend robert w . fogel 's & quot ; the fourth great awakening and the future of egalitarianism . &quot ; fogel , a nobel prize winner , has all the optimism of fukuyama but with the history to back it up

this out of all the many versions of jane eyre has to be my least favorite.. . granted samantha morton has a very adorable fairy / elfin like face like mr rochesters description of her , but her acting has no highs and lows . she stands up to mr edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers , seemingly no respect to her employer , which is not fault of hers , the writing of the script is bad... . and so the direction . ciaran hinds is totally over the top . he is so angry with no understanding , his eyes are very lustful and at times crazed . he is not at all like the character described in brontes epic book of a very sad and tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the innocence and singular personality of earnest , honest and yet strong sweet jane eyre that charlotte bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words . the over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical.to me there is no love , feeling or chemistry here between the two actors just lust... . he seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl , and she though supposedy a virgin.. . she dos n't act like one . plus this movie seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story especially during janes childhood . i do also miss the gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the dalton / clarke mini series , which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story . if you want to see great versions . i highly rate the 1944 movie with orson wells though it is another abreviatd version , that movie truly captured the spirit and feel . it is moody dark and mysterious . another is the fantastic timothy dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the brontes story . dalton 's and clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime ! however if you are like me , see them all and make your own decision . they all have something to offer and most are entertaining.. .

first , the story takes place in the 1940s ( harold 's brother is mia in wwii , not in vietnam , as the amazon.com review erroneously states ) . second , the writing is superb . mr. lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel . his characters are very real . his setting ( a small , struggling circus , traveling the western u.s. ) is historically believable , peopled with ' freaks ' who suffer as sideshows , unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with , but peopled also with ' normals ' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks . harold , the 14-year-old albino central character , tries to straddle both groups of people . he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer . i am admittedly ignorant about such things , but mr. lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants- -crucial to the plot of the novel- -seem believable . my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end . i do want you to read this book , so i will try not to give anything away here , but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character 's last words and even gomer pyle-like ( people actuallly say " gosh ! " ) . this did detract from the impact of the death , unfortunately , but i still very strongly recommend this book . five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot !

great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity . though edited by bob blaisdell , who presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions , the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day . their messages speak for themselves . a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections . one is their brevity . the speakers get to the point and make it clearly . few inclusions run longer than five pages . there is also a level of genuine ( and often sad ) honesty . many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians ' efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation , if such a thing was possible at the time . the tone is often one of resignation , but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners . it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not , but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed , rightly or wrongly , the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat . even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts . the style could almost be considered anti-oratorical , though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own . one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english . nonetheless , the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people , separated by years , language , and geography who retain a clear-headed means of addressing their listeners

i appreciate bands like ima robot , film school and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into alternative music , or at least i appreciate film school for trying to merge the beauty of electronica with alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the new wave you loved in the 80's . the thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band . have you heard depeche mode 's albums with a wind of boards of canada ? call this the album that it would have made more sense for maximo park to create if you will but this album is america 's response to all other international bands showing us off hard . ( the band is from san francisco , i believe ) and their influence for this album is a mix of electronica and 80 's music ( my bloody valentine . new order ? depeche mode ? ) all leading them to create an album that does n't quite call the band in question an american radiohead per se , but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars , accompanying keyboards , and a leaders effort to push the band forward , a band that is trying to reach heights of originality . film school 's debut ( if you are n't counting their imported ep ) kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating " on and on " that may force your urge to name this band after interpol and elefant and a little bit of the bravery in there , too , but will not let you throughout this entire album . their current single " pitfalls " may cause them to swing on the vine of similarity since everyone is trying to bring back new wave these days , but worse can happen for a band like this . the backward keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference . the second actual interlude " garrison " is where boards of canada 's wind starts blowing through the cd , before heading back into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of " cool " . if there is ever an album to chase after and count on for the safety of new wave and the health of alternative , i do n't see a better candidate for leg-ups than film school 's latest . rating : 7.5 / 1

having had perfectly clear skin through my teens , 20s , and most of my 30s , i now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36. my skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most otc acne products . i bought this product out of desperation , not believing it would work . after reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks , i have found that it works well , with some modifications . my experience : cystic acne goes through its normal cycle ( rising to surface , becoming a hideous scab , etc. ) in a fraction of the normal time ( 4 days versus 4 weeks ) when treated as directed with zeno , or it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface ( after a week or so ) , when treated very aggressively with zeno . my advice : do n't expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised . do know that with diligence and patience , it will work . be very aggressive . do double-cycles ( allow the zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps , then press the button for a second cycle ) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way . you may get very slight burning of your skin ( causing a whitish film or slight peeling ) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly , but believe me , it 's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne . i am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition , and seeing the results i have hoped for after 2 weeks

the bad news first : does n't seem to work well without adding extra detergent it seems like this is not 3x concentration , and like others we found we had to compensate by adding more detergent than the directions said to get the same results as we did with the standard formula . otherwise , the two products , ' concentrated ' and ' standard srength ' are the same . make no mistake about it - this is concentrated & comes out like heinz ketchup : it does seem to be concentrated , and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle , kind of reminded us of heinz ketchup . 4-star or 5-star product ? the standard strength product is clearly a 5-star product , however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim , it rates 4-stars with our family . trying to learn objective info on laundry detergent is well . . . . the following is true of this product in standard strength or 3x with extra detergent added : i am allergic to most laundry detergents , but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years . it is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available . in addition to being very easy on clothes and skin , it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak . this is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens . it is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this , you may have to pre-soak stains and you wo n't have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it . while " tide " and " cheer " are also available in hypoallergenic formulas , [ " tide free " is actually just unscented] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience . that 's why i like this " all liquid detergent - free clear , laundry detergent " . objective information is tough to find ! i actually did conduct a hard target search for true , objective information on laundry detergents . there is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which , while important , is not what i was trying to find . " consumer reports " does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail . about " all 's website " if you are looking for this product 's website it is under " unilever " and you will have to specify " usa " under products , as the word " all " will show up in almost every search result . you will find " wisk " and " breyer 's ice cream " and almost as many neat name brand products as you would at procter and gamble 's site .

the population of hong kong is approximately 7 million people . i 'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie . usually when a movie runs over 2 hours , it 's because there 's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in . in the case of hard boiled , the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo 's desire to get into the guinness book of records for " most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture . " chow yun-fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay , and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff . he shoots ( usually with a pistol in each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture , while swinging from a rope , while sliding down a banister ( ! ) , while being hurled through the air by explosions . sometimes he even shoots while standing still . and he shoots , and shoots , and shoots . and the bad guys shoot , and shoot , and shoot . and yun-fat 's fellow cops shoot , and shoot , and - - you get the idea . there are some fine action scenes in this film , but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended . there was n't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next , and it became painfully repetitious . personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled . there 's plenty of yun-fat 's balletic shoot-em-up action , but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire

" a woman left at home would close her eyes and the power of her need would enable her to see her man on his ocean ship battling pirates with pistol , her man in the battle 's fray with his sword and shield , standing victorious among corpses , her man in a desert whose sands were on fire , amid mountain peaks , drinking the driven snow . so long as he lived she would follow his journey , would feel his elation and his grief , and if he died a spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her waiting omniscient heart . it would be the same for him . in the midst of desert 's fire he would feel her cool hand on his cheek and in the heat of battle she would murmur the words of love into his ear : live , live . that was what the stories said about love . that was what human beings knew love to be . " shalimar the clown was about as good as i thought it would be . it definitely is n't the best book i 've read this year but i must say salman rushdie 's writing style captivates me nonetheless . in between the most relevant paragraphs , he says things that are unique and have a true stronghold on the reader 's mindset . in this book , he mentions a quote , twice , which really caught my eye . " one does n't know the questions of life until one is asked " another thing i noticed about the book is that the central character , shalimar , is seldom mentioned . the book seems to hover around other dozen characters . only in prison and in that one letter sent back to kashmira does shalimar 's true character really come out . the second quarter of the book got immensely boring and i really despise how max 's character was written about . it was annoying , difficult to read , over-detailed and excruciating to read . boonyi was an outstanding character . so was the old witch and boonyi 's father . when colonel tortoise was mentioned in the book , i thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing about yielded anything . one could n't help but dislike max 's lack of integrity . mythology is rather well written about in this book . every 50 pages , a one page something would be mentioned including just the right amount of detail and words . conclusion - while reading , time and again i would rage on to my friend about how superb the writer 's grasp on the reader is . the writer knows his words , where to use them , he knows that he has a prodigious way of writing and he employed them better than ever . maybe this book disappointed his core fans . maybe it lacked a spark enough to obilerate doubt . all in all , i can say that salman rushdie has a wierd way of his own . his vocabulary is truly astounding . maybe he is the most " learned " writer i 've ever read , if not the best . respect . h.s anand -17th october'06 12.13p

this model has all the features of the elite 9500 ( 2 brush heads , 2 cleaning modes , programmable quadpacer , and a guage to indicate about how much charge is remaining in the battery ) , but it 's $12 cheaper from amazon ! all the " programmable quadpacer " feature amounts to is the ability to leave it on for an extra ( i.e. , a fifth ) 30-second interval , or the ability to turn the timer off so that it 's just on / off . i regard most of the features as functional ornamentation ( " bells and whistles " ) , but the elite 9800 also happens to be a dependable , super-lightweight model that will run a good three weeks on a charge with only one person using it . i went on a three-week trip and did n't bother to pack my charger , and it had charge to spare when i got back . note : i always allow the nicd battery run all the way down ( to exhaustion ) before charging it , and that enhances both the charge and battery life . ( nicd 's only have so many charge cycles . ) if this is your first electric , you might like the way it comes out of the box programmed to gradually ramp-up the power over the first fourteen brushings . what 's the difference between the 9800 and the 9500 ? the models appear identical . the only difference i found is that one comes in a box that says 9800 , the other says 9500. : - )

the dictators are incredible . few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock ' n ' roll ideals as these guys have , and their spinal-tap-meets-ramones-mees-beach-boys style almost always works - almost . " manifest destiny " is a dissapointing release from the ' tators . i mean its not a bad album , but the guys can do much better than this . there are a few good songs . " disease " is hilarious , particulary the spoken word act from handsome dick at the begining . " science gone too far " is one of the band 's catchiest tunes , proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s . their closing cover of the stooges ' " search & destroy " is an okay interperatation of the classic . however , that 's about it . the rest are mostly humorless fm-style rockers , and while the dictators were n't selling out , they were certainly trying to become more accesible . download those three tunes , and pick up every other album by the band

i installed norton antivirus 2007 immediately after installing windows vista , office 2007 and other software on a new computer . installation ran smoothly . liveupdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch . norton antivirus 2007 not only detects viruses , it detects spyware and rootkits as well . it has an inbound firewall , and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities . it does not protect against phishing , identity theft , or spam , nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection . when installed on windows vista , norton antivirus takes over for windows defender and the windows firewall . i did not expect the latter ; symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall . norton antivirus integrates well with windows security center . norton antivirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions . norton antivirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products . the only other product that i would use myself is mcafee virusscan , but i have always felt that norton antivirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system . for those of you installing norton antivirus 2007 as an upgrade , i would highly recommend that you first remove any existing norton security products using add / remove programs in the control panel . then , download and run the norton removal tool from the symantec site to make sure that it 's all gone . to see a comparison chart of the norton 2007 windows protection products as of this posting date , browse to symantec 's site , click on " norton 2007 products " under home products , click on related link " view all products " and then click " compare " next to pc security .

i was disappointed in this video . i came to it not as a devout catholic but as a fan of travel videos . in other words , i watched this video with the same motivation i would have to watch shackleton 's antarctic exploration , or something from the globe trekker series . with that in mind , the target audience for this video is not me . it is the religious catholic . therefore , from my perspective , i ca n't recommend it . i 'm not one for all the pomp and circumstance of religion . i do n't enjoy worshipping the " holy father " , or watching the construction of the clownish uniform of the swiss guard . if you are a devout catholic you will probably enjoy this video . if you are not , and just came to the video because you wanted a globe trekker style tour of the vatican , you are likely to be disappointed . and that is what these reviews are for - to let you know whether you will enjoy the video or not

i 've been using norton antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with norton internet security 2003. now that it 's time to renewal norton antivirus , i thought i switch to trend micro internet secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines . i like norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the taskmanager considering i was running a p3 500 laptop with 196mb on winxp pro , resources are valuable . also newer norton antivirus version were a hit and miss . after also reading reviews at amazon , i took the plunge with trend micro . my review of this product can be best summarize along with it 's relations to norton antivirus 2002 ( updated ) . pros of trend micro 2005 : 1. fastest virus scan i 've seen . i have not find any virus in my system yet whereas norton would fail in about .01% of the time ( i.e. one stalling virus every year ) . 2. check incoming and outgoing mail like norton 3. scan selected files as i chose just like norton 4. alert and block virus threats 5. monitor nearby wifi connection 6. $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15. ( it 's been 2 months since i 've mailed it and not received it yet ) . 7. uses about 10mb of system background resources versus norton 's 30mb . cons against trend micro 2005 : 1. very annoying auto-virus update every day that i log on the internet . i only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes . i 'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so i would prefer to have a preference setting that i can choose myself . norton is not as annoying . 2. on a wifi network , trend micro firewall failed 5 of the gibson research shields up test . ports were open . norton internet firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which was n't a big worry . i ended up disabling trend micro firewall and using the norton firewall instead as it 's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection . 3. anti-spam and data protection were subpar as i got advertisements and pop-up from certain websites like west cost major newspaper . using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again . 4. still waiting for rebate . overall , i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 for it 's fast virus check and a separate norton internet firewall is the ideal combo for me . on it 's own merit , trend micro would be perfect only if ram and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but i would n't mind using norton if i had plentiful more ram .

the purpose of nessus is to provide an open source solution for network auditing on all unix like systems . this book not only details using nessus but also comes with a cd containing the program , as well as ethereal , snort , and newt ( a port of the program to the windows environment ) . what is a network assessment ? at its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment , services , applications , and vulnerabilities on that system . basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external . an internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the lan . nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either , or both of them . the authors do an excellent job of detailing installation , setup , and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report . one of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system . some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows , default passwords , backdoors , information leaks , and denial of service . the nessus scripting language is covered in detail in appendix a instead of the main portion of the book ; a choice i appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section . with open source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help . so , the authors include information on how to get help via the nessus user community , mailing lists , and archives . nessus network auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality

murky : in his book , 1984 , orwell described a contrived language he called " newspeak " , designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible . but before orwell there were russell and whitehead , who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence . as whitehead wrote in his " foreword " to quine 's ph.d . dissertation titled a system of logic : logic shapes metaphysical thought . thus in his " on universals " quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as " entities " . and he co-authored with goodman " steps toward a constructive nominalism " , a nominalist manifesto , in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or " platonists " depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities . i believe that anyone who says that universals are " referenced " or who uses the phrase " abstract entities " fully deserves to be labeled a platonist . but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak . in the " search inside this book " screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting ( p . 20 ) that realists say universals are shared " entities " and are " referents " of predicates . i ask loux : what happened to signification ? the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense ( i.e. signification ) as well as denotation ( i.e. reference ) in the functional ( i.e. predicate ) calculus . i ask loux : what happened to supposition , which distinguishes reference from signification ? in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions ( i.e. significations ) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization ( i.e. reference ) , and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects . i ask loux : since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else ? is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric ? i see murky writing . muddled : loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine , the pragmatic realist , who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism , and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing . ontological relativity started as an analogy : quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time . einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton 's absolute time , and he rejected lorentz 's making relativistic time apparent time . likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory 's positing of duality and indeterminacy . today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition , nonlocality and calabi-yau spaces in eleven dimensions . quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs . realism is a natural , primordial , irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories . on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial . it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history . it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories . but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity , and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity " anti-realism " . in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism , but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change . i do not find this book contemporary . loux 's " realism - anti-realism " locution is a false dichotomy . i see muddled thinking . marginalized : while a student i found notre dame 's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism . when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking . i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students . readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site . thomas j . hicke

it 's amazing how a little common sense can turn into a million you know what's . as soon as i tried these i realized how much better they are than the usual throat lozenges . why ? because others cause you to suck on them , and this strains your throat muscles , which is bad . gummi lozenges , it 's genius . why did n't i think of it . then again , i did , but i did n't create airborne which is wonderful in itself . really , these lozengers are great . at night if you use one they just stay pretty much stuck to the side of your throat and you can fall asleep without even the thought that you could shallow it and choke . just remember how long it takes for a normal lozenge to disolve without bitting it ( even then ) . these go pretty quick , and without crewing ( which is the best way to use them ) . i myself try to always have them in the house . you should , and will do the same after you try them . also the price on amazon is the best . i 'm about to order 10 boxes ( would order more but for the shipping charge , which even with is still cheaper then target ) . maybe the owner should put me on the payroll .

eugene o'neill 's play " long day 's journey into night " is a pulitzer award winning , autobiographical play about his family . i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater , i did not enjoy reading this play . the tyrone family 's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read . i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion . the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends . no happy ending , no hope for the future , just despair . " long day 's journey into night " is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without . however , after learning more about eugene o'neill 's background , and the extent to which the play is based on his life , i began to have a greater appreciation for this play . o'neill did lead a very hard life , therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill 's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner . while o'neill 's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending , it was appropriate for the play as eugene 's own family never got a happy ending . i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family 's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue . at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal , loving family . the audience soon however , gets the suspicion that something is n't quite right , and that the family is tense . slowly the family 's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members , but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up . thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well , their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth . although i still believe " long day 's journey into night " to be thoroughly disheartening to read , the reader 's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill 's exceptional writing .

ca n't really add much to the reviews . this is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older . i 'll admit that when this came out in ' 94 , i only bumped the singles . it did n't grab me at the time . sometime around ' 97 i gave it a spin and i 've been loving it ever since . there are plenty of bangers on the album , but classics like " pour out a little liquor " , " str8 ballin ' " , " how long will they mourn me " , cradle to the grave " , and " under pressure " make this album worth owning all by themselves . the rest of the songs are on point too - - there is n't much filler on this album . the production is handled by warren g . & nate dogg ( 1 ) , the awesone yet underrated easy mo b ( 1 ) , johnny j ( 1 ) , jay & mopreme ( 1 ) , jay & syke ( 1 ) , stretch ( 1 ) , and thug music ( 4 ) . i 'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks . the only tracks that i would call skip material are " sh** do n't stop " and " do n't get it twisted " . " sh** do n't stop " is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive . the production is on " do n't get it twisted " cool , but it 's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it ( in my opinion ) . volume 1 is a passionate , if at times misdirected , release from the thug life camp . the production is nothing short of vintage mid 90 's cali vibes . it holds up very well 13 years after its release . of course , if you 're a tupac completist , you probably have this album already . but even if you 're not a pac fan , this should be a part of your collection . r.i.p. tupac standout tracks : how long will they mourn me feat . nate dogg , pour out a little liquor , str8 ballin ' ( my favorite ) , cradle to the grave , under pressure , bury me a g feat . natasha walker ( of y.n.v. )

like so many new-age artists , ryan farish has a great ear for melodies . unlike most new-age artists , ryan farish has rhythmic problems . he likes to use the delay effect on his piano , but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing ( sometimes it 's one problem and sometimes it 's both ) . i do n't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album . also , the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly

i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i was n't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning . but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much . once he did start playing , gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in . by the time things settle down , the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface . the mix is horrible . the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize , he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out . i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the " concert experience " . there are high points in the show , but the low points are rock bottom . comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart . two versions are provided on this dvd - from the concert and in the bonus section . neither of the guest singers ( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff ) know the words , have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before . gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience . the very best thing on this dvd is , oddly enough , in the bonus section . screamin ' jay hawkins ' i put a spell on you , a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland , almost makes the dvd worth buying . almost . watch jonathan demme 's beautiful treatment of neil young : heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show . that is the gold standard .

i must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were . heisenberg 's uncertainty principle was just an equation i learned . hawking made it seem like common sense . hawking tries a little too hard to be witty at times ( and punctuates all of his jokes with exclamation points ! just in case you missed them ! ) , but all-in-all , this was a quite readable account of what 's presently known about cosmology . i use the term " presently " guardedly , as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter ( it exists ! ) , but from now on , when there are new findings in physics , i want hawking to explain them to me , because i feel like then i might understand them . that 's why you should read this book . the reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life , and would rather read about global warming or darfur or something a bit more topical and practical . this was still a hard read , and i feel like i grasped maybe 80% of it . for you to decide , but for a former engineering student , this was something i wish i had read when i was taking physics

" i am one of those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back to version 9 ) , and finally with version 10.6 i have stopped complaining - - it now works as i 'd hoped when i bought it . the $300 i spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted - - i kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual could n't clarify . and i 'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures . i am turning all of our old family video tapes and cd 's into dvd's . i use studio for all the editing ( have not tried the dvd recording - - just use roxio for that ) and am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download . one important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems : put every " project " you work on in a separate subdirectory . if you have 5 soccer game videos make a / game1 , / game2 etc. series of subfolders . if you edit those to a " jimmy 's great plays " proect , put it in a separate / jimmyplays folder . when projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5. i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , and i do n't know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why did i stick with something where i admit that version 9.0 was " powerful but unstable " and 10.0 was " more powerful and more unstable " ? because i can actually use studio with minimal reference to instructions , and when i use it things turn out as i expect . now that it has become stable and reliable i am a very satisfied customer . so that 's how i got from being a frustrated studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review . i tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions , but that " 10.5 updated for free to 10.6 " really is the best choice out there now.. . as my unused expensive rivals to studio on my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder !

as a lover of gospel bluegrass i anticipated an enjoyable listening session with blue highway 's latest offering . let me first say that i am a fan of this group , which i consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom , but what i heard was bluegrass muzak . yes , the group 's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence , and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller , but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing . gospel music , even bluegrass gospel , has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves . a good gospel recording must have some cuts which are humorous , some serious and contemplative , some that push the envelope of orthodoxy , and most importantly it must have an element of fun in order to keep the attention of the listeners . this disc fails in that regard containing standard old gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards . my advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new , or buy used . want mine

most other reviewers listed here believe that this cd is good - i wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier mannheim cd 's have made it difficult to critique a mannheim offering ! i am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular cd sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music , just with different chords . in fact , if i was not paying specific attention , i could n't tell when one song ended and another started ! i enjoyed what i heard , but i was certainly expecting more from this cd - many of these disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least , some variety seems to have been called for . disney has always included great music with their movies , running the gamut of musical styles such as classical , jazz , blues , and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high . i do , however , highly recommend mannheim cd 's in general - just not this one

these are not the original theatrical realeases . in addition to the changes made in the special edition versions of the films , american cinematographer noted in their review of the dvd release that they had gone so far as to change the color-timing of the transfer so that the color scheme more closely resembled the more recent prequels . though they are an impressive technical achievement , i 'll be buying the academy award winning films that i saw when i was younger

lately there has been a lot of talk about how great ronald reagan was as a president . this book shows that this is not even close to being true . under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world . him and his administration sold missles to iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support contras in latin america . under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices . all this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle-class while giving the rich more money . it is debated whether reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book . it is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book . the only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program . recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency

i installed this unit in my basement about 6 months ago , and it has been working flawlessly ever since . things i noticed : if the power goes out , the unit will not turn back on automatically ( as some other units do . ) if you want to use the continuous drainage ( which i highly recommend ) via a hose , you have to punch out a plastic disc on the side of the unit . i would have designed a screw-type plug that was replacable , but they did n't think of that . anyway , once you punch the quarter-size disc out it 's out forever . if you choose to use the continuous drainage feature , you will need to pick up a hose with an inner diameter of 15mm ( .59 " or just over half an inch . ) i went to the local diy center and found some clear tubing that has worked well . the unit can operate down to 2-degrees c ( 36-degrees f ) , which will be great for continuous operation in the garage to keep the tools from rusting . has three fan settings : med , high and quiet . " quiet " really is quiet , and could probably work just fine in a bedroom . though , it does warm the room it 's in . how much it warms it depends on the humidity setting . four settings : the humidty level ( humidstat ) can be set to " continuous dehumidification " ( which is the default setting ) , 50% , 60% and 70%. the fan will continue to run but the dehumidification processor will turn off when it reaches the selected humidity level . cool . i mean , that 's when the fan will just blow room-temp air . a full drainage tank will stop the unit and illuminate a " tank full " indicator light . the unit is not that heavy - - maybe for some , but not nearly as heavy as some people make it sound . it 's 30.8 pounds . according to the instructions : you will need at least 21 cm ( about 8 inches ) of clearance in front , behind and side to side . air blows out of the top of the unit , so you 'll need to make sure it 's clear as well . there are movable louvers on the top to direct the air straight up , 45-degrees or almost straight ahead . power consumption : cfm-25e is 220w / / cfm-40e is 330w i highly recommend this model dehumidifier

this dvd was the first one released by michael buble , and i bought it in hopes of seeing some of his live performances . there are segments of performances , but the editing and fast , wild cuts from one angle to the next to the next to the next really detract from the overall effect . the performances get largely lost . what remains is a lot of footage of michael and his original bandmembers drinking , clubbing , gambling , womanizing , and generally acting like rowdy frat boys . if you really want to be wowed and experience what a live buble concert is like , i highly recommend " caught in the act " . this dvd lives up to it 's name as part of the pbs great performances series produced by david foster . " caught in the act " is slick , glossy , flashy , enormously fun and absolutely true to the real experience . i 've seen buble perform live twice , and i can attest that " caught in the act " is just about as good as being there

i was blown away by the wonderful acting of juliet lewis and giovanni ribisi who played the retarded young adults . this was a very compassionate film about the realities of living with a disability . disabled people desire and deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else . it was wonderful to see the love " carla " ' s siblings and parents had for her . there were 2 reasons i did n't give this movie 5 stars . one was that diane keaton 's character of the overly controlling mother was annoying . obviously she was supposed to be annoying , but i think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines , she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again . another reason i did n't love this film was because hollywood once again compels right wing nut jobs to write reviews that portray themselves as normal and good . sorry , hollywood , but there will always be those of us who still believe god 's word to be true . being a right wing nut job is n't considered normal or ok in the bible . god never created it . look it up . you are not helping people who struggle with it to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle .

american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree . i read the human stain a few years ago , and it was good . but , in pastoral , the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst , and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst , but absent the psychoanalyst : roth is our psychoanalyst . what he misses , however , is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control . the swede never failed as a father ; rather , he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her

following on from the fantastic ' the duel ' allison moorer 's latest release ' getting somewhere ' is a massive , massive disappointment . quite simply the material on ' getting somewhere ' is weak and gutless . on the rare occasions moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of ' the duel ' - such as on hallelujah & new years day - earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish , pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! business and pleasure rarely mix and moorer should take a long , hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing rs field next time around . if moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then earle is simply not the man for the job . moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre ( she can write a mean song too ! ) . this cd showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately

i just saw this move for the first time in wide screen and it is a much different experience i must say . i think i have figured it out . in some other reviews i think batricia birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers . i think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground . it is somewhat of a good story . i can see why it would be reversed ( a guy trying to get the girl , instead of the other way around ) . you see eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus . well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one ? ? ? ? also frenchie is not with the pink ladies at all . you see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school . i think the chemistry between stephanie and michael were worked well together . the songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie . so really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether . i know i know it is not the first one . but sequels are usually not , but they usually have connections to the first . grease 2 tried to accomplish with frenchie and the tbirds , pink ladies and all . i am glad they were able to have eve arden , sid ceaser , plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like tab hunter . is this movie cheesy ? ? ? ? yes is it done in less than expected direction ? ? ? ? yes . does it have good songs ? ? yes ( cool rider , reproduction , we 'll always be together , girl for all seasons / turn back , and back to school ) . the song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one . after all kiddies , patricia birch did do the choreography for both . so , in closing , this movie made it to my dvd collection if for that reason alone . if grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek . if it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that . i think if you loved the first grease then i think you should at least give this one a try .

i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book . this is not a book about cosmology ( as people would expect from roger penrose ) . in this tiny book , penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes ( something much different from the opinion of 99 , 99% of neurobiologists , such as steven pinker ) . this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell-mann . the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories ( thus , the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works ! ) . some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they did n't had in mind that this book is about penrose 's point of view on intelligence . in fact , i 'm not a physicist , nor a biologist , simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand , although i do not agree with penrose 's point of view . i think he forgot something very important . read it and read the other point of view and you 'll find what it is ! :

16:9 standard definition video with 3 mp stills . i have taken about one hour of hd video so far , and have viewed it through an hdmi cable on a sony 46 " xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured a few indoor scenes , a few neighborhood outdoor scenes , and some footage at harper 's ferry in west virginia - river , mountain , and two trains passing by at close range while i was at the railroad station there . i can say comfortably that you wo n't confuse the video from this camcorder with standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they are n't kidding . if your tv can show the video off to advantage and you 've grown fond of hd , i think you 'd be pleased with this camcorder . in my case , the overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders was to get the hd video , so this has made it worth the steep expense . my second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so i only have to carry one piece of equipment around . i already had this in the sony hc90 at 3mp , so going up to 6mp was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself . my only output criticisms so far are that the west virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than i remember . i did n't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt . these camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which i have not explored . one or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage , and i 'm not unhappy with what i think i noticed in the slightest . the stills look very good to me so far , but i 've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the tv . i normally view stills on a pc . i do n't have a telephoto lens yet so i ca n't report on the quality of the stabilization . i used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video . i was very pleased , by the way , with how well the camera did with the moving trains . very crisp where i expected a fair bit of motion blur . lcd size and controls have been mentioned in first looks . i 'm perfectly happy with a 2.7 " lcd instead of the larger one in the ux7. so this was n't a negative for me personally . the controls ( menus ) are highly similar to those of the sony hc90 i already have . if you have n't seen them before , there 's a learning curve . if you have the hc90 or another camcorder with those menus , you 'll be right at home with the hc7. one note : you can configure p[ersonal]-menus to include the things you use the most in your own order , in addition to the camcorder 's menus . one thing i forgot is that each mode ( video , camera , play / edit ) has its own configurable personal menu . so i was looking for things to add to the play / edit personal menu that i was sure should be configurable , but could n't find them . that was because they belonged only to the filming side , not to the playback side . so you 've got three personal menus you can create , not one . battery : check the sizes on the batteries . the hc90 batteries were very thin . i think three of the batteries for the hc7 fit entirely within its case . the fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that i thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1 / 2 " or so . the other three will fit flush into the back of the camera , though they 're not behind a door or anything . battery life : my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate , but the batteries drain faster than that of the hc90. this is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones . the ccds and the stills and everything are all " more " than in the hc90. so i think i 'm fine with the battery life , but you 'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery . size compared to the hc90 : this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the hc90. it 's maybe 1 / 2 " longer front to back , and wider as well . i think the hc7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder i see in best buy . but it 's noticeably smaller than last year 's sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i do n't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like i did with the hc90 , but it 's pretty light and still fits in the case i used for the hc90 if i do n't load other stuff in there . fit in the hand : i found a best buy with an hc5 and ux5 on hand and played with both at the same time . these have the same footprint as the hc7 and ux7 as far as i can tell . the hc5 's tape case is maybe 3 / 8 " wider than the ux5 's dvd case . the ux5 's dvd case is maybe 1 / 4 " higher . so i found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller ux5 and it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found that the hc5 's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb . as i played with this in the store , i realized it seemed like the hc5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this . absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you . just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ) : i spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year 's avchd ux camcorders would still be present , and if i would care in any case . the detailed reviews still are n't out , so i do n't know whether there will be a noise problem there . but i can say i noticed nothing in the footage so far that i 'd call noise , so my decision to go with the tape and hdv format looks very good to me right now . i have never had the problems people report with mini-dv tapes , so that whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) did n't weigh on me much . the noise discussion did have an effect on my decision , though . getting the video to your tv : " how much money do we have ? " , apparently . i played the tape back to the tv directly , but that 's not a long-term solution . i have heard that you can capture the hdv video and then will be able to transform it on a pc to formats suitable for blu-ray or hdv burners , if you have the money . then you need a blu-ray or hdv player attached to your tv . for now , it sounds like many people are archiving the hdv video to dvds as data files . then they burn playable dvds where the hd is down-converted to standard definition video . so they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce hd versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied that hd files captured by ulead software could be moved to a ps3 hard drive and played back to an hd tv from there . so far , the easy and cheap path we have for sd video to dvds to tvs is not quite there for hd based on what i 've read . the one extra feature i wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20x optical zoom . i 'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively , so i " understand " . but that would be #1 on my wish list . overall , i am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now . i know we 're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago . but it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around , take some video , and then have play it back on a high-quality hd tv looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it 's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new tvs so beautifully .

i do n't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it . it is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did....and realize that you forgot to select " test " at the beginning . also , it seems that testing should be available for the ' guided exercise ' also ...... not just the regular exercises . other than these two things , the program is very good

this film had a powerful effect on me . 95% of the people i know do n't read books . i met a millionaire not long ago , who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life . lady di was reported never to have read anything - - - except perhaps fashion mags . my children hardly read , and their husbands and wives certainly don't . my ex-wife never read anything . her father thought ulysses was a dirty book . i stopped watching television in 1980 , and i own 10 , 000 books - - - but not fahrenheit 451 , which i 'd read about 45 years ago . this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury 's text , but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear , and with a very solid punch to the plexus . the manner in which it is written , played and directed , added to its impact . this world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us . the style was strange , but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal . people live and work like automated morons . they ca n't think for themselves , and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied . they ca n't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind : in fact , present them with an idea , or attempt to initiate a discussion , and they 'll often become angry . some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts . ludicrous suggestions : remake it with mad mel gibson . have infantile spielberg direct it . bulk it out with computerised sfx . these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets , and many of them seem unable to understand their own language , let alone write it , or spell it . this is a memorable film , for those whose memories still function . unlike the captain of the firemen

this a " mystery-triller " starring tom berenger , gretta scacchi , corbin bernsen , joanne whalley-kilmer and bob hoskins , it 's the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive.she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically , crashing all the way.she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm , while he amazingly lives , at first leaving him in a coma , but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger.he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia.later , after being nursed back to health and " falling in love with his wife all over again , " he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man.obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth . it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller , but comes predictable fast.i knew the key ' mysteries ' almost immediately and i 'm sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law & order episodes will agree.eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments.i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again

overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your panasonic lx1 or lx2 camera , but it has a few major flaws . first , there is no simple way to attach it to your belt . there is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it wo n't fit any belt more than 1 / 2 " wide . also , there are two zippers on this case , one on each side , which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket . finally , the velcro tab that closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own . this might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase , but not for carrying around for everyday use .

while well produced , i was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings . frankie laine still sounds great - but it just was n't the same . i bought the cd to replace a well worn vinyl album , but on listening to the cd i found the songs to all be slightly ( and in a couple of cases very ) , different in tempo and vocal inflection - it 's definitely not the album i 've loved for over 30 years ! high noon in particular is quite different , much slower , with vocal emphasis changed . i 'll probably listen to the cd from time to time , but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp

on an episode of seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is , the always wily and oh so goofy character of kramer is playing a game of risk and exclaims that the " ukraine is weeeeak " . this causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble . i think the same basic sentiments work with this new order release . it probably was n't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent " rock the shack " and of course " crystal " , which i 'll get back to later . unlike kramer i feel i can make this statement safely as i 'm not dealing with a burly , alcohol swigging ukranian , but new order fans , which are n't the most intimidating bunch out there . keyboardist gillian gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important , which it is , maybe . this album features the guitar of billy corgan , the frontman of the seminal 90 's group soundgarden . too bad they could n't get billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy , and was n't writing very good material or really using his guitar , at all . new order also made the mistake of having corgan to backing vocals . now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough , but to top that off with a billy corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice . so...someone like you is more or less unlistenable . it has some pretty terrible lyrics about how bernard does n't want to wash his car . now i can relate , i would n't want to wash my car in britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair , but this topic does n't result in the most captivating and well-written material . new order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album , something they do n't do very often , just like van morrison . now i 'm not sure if i 've heard a van morrison song but i 've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars . case in point of this ` not so good of an idea rawking ' is rock the shack . rock the shack kind of sounds like new order 's take on someone commissioned to write an epic gilligan 's island rock song , pretty amazing huh ? ' 60 miles an hour ' , ` primitive notion ' , and ` close range ' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland . new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 's artist like depeche mode , the cure , and tears for fears ( who 've actually always blown ) . however , they do succeed fully well on two songs here . there is ` crystal ' , which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order 's career from the 90 's and beyond . how this did n't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me , because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it . the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song , in the vein of ` as it is when it was . probably new order 's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic , moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album . get ready is good beginning and end , just not end between . kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me

eight years ago today was the day blondie 's reunion album was released , and though it was great to see blondie back together , no exit just fell short on many levels . 2004 's the curse of blondie ( see my review also on amazon ) is a much better album and should have been their comeback . no exit wo n't exactly take you back to the hooks that made blondie famous . harry 's lyrics are wonderful in " double take , " but the deadpan melody literally kills the song . fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards ( " boom boom in the zoom zoom room " ) or revamped demo tracks ( " out in the streets " ) , but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by coolio . both the band and coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about . the music is n't catchy either . all is not lost with songs like " night wind sent , " and harry 's own transformation in " forgive and forget , plus who would dare argue blondie 's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear " maria . " as the album 's best track , " maria " is a wonderful reminder of how blondie , and debbie , can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind

what is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book - - which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel - - is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24. nope , the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced " the great gatsby " a mere five years later . " this side of paradise " is a mess : it is as uneven , affected , feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero , the tiresomely self-conscious young minnesotan-gone-to-princeton amory blaine . ( one suspects , in fact , that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory 's diary the result would have been considerably more readable - - or the book 's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable , at least . ) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 - - it was to prove the most popular book , in terms of sales , ever produced by its author - - presumably speaks to the public 's recognition of something new and revealing in it . okay , amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype ; and the drinking and shameless smooching ( etc. ) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably , one can accept , a revelation to see in print ( and likely a titillating one ) for an american audience raised on mcguffy 's readers - - and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war . welp , here it comes : " on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon , the ` petting party . ' none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed . " to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is , of course , very small beer . what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now , in the best cases of the paradise narrative , as unalarming quaintness . while this is not exactly fitzgerald 's " fault " , so to speak , it is also true that the use of " shocking revelations " of this type - - scandals specific to a place and time - - represents a risk a writer takes : the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and / or universal in such episodes . in any event , the price the reader pays here , in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory 's adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties , is very , very high for payoffs of such modest proportions . i mean , come on : " for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart . the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds , he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore ; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it . eleanor was , say , the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty , the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes . " yikes . i do n't care what new generation you 're talking about , can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody ? ( can it represent anything to anybody ? ) there are things to like , even admire , here and there in paradise . fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark ( e.g. , " they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered . " " sometimes i wish i 'd been an englishman ; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy . " " it 's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes ; they do it so much better . " ) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator 's observations is , in its now-curious way , refreshingly , bracingly funny : " slowly and inevitably , yet with a sudden surge at the last , while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht] , war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played . every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings . when amory went to washington the next weekend , he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back , for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks , he guessed , or russians . " nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there 's a war on , i always say . anyway , most of the novel consists of young amory 's elaborate ponderings - - romantic , philosophical and egotistical - - which are as forgivable as they are forgettable . i 've forgotten them already . at some level , in any case , fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character - - who was , of course , a not-very-disguised version of himself . for how else , if not as commendably self-deprecating irony , are we to take this observation ? " amory was in full stride , confident , nervous , and jubilant . scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do , so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him , and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours . " in the end , in any event , one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs. fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder . in paradise almost nothing works : form , content , narrative stance , dialogue , character development , pacing - - you name it , it 's a problem . yet in gatsby , five years later , everything works - - everything . if there is to be a great american novel , it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor . while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b , the fact is that he did - - and without point a the journey could not have begun . so while " this side of paradise " hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon , it surely deserves our respect , and indeed our gratitude , for what it led to .

i respect the message of " the unexpected legacy of divorce " but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce " unexpected . " those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result . staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times . the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit . i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time . they fell apart due to abuse , infidelity , and just plain incompatibility . what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents . when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids , most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house . when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority , who constantly disappoints , hurts , and replaces the kids , there will be damage , no getting away from it . however , is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids , seemingly with the other parent 's approval ? i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion . it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married . this is a major flaw in the research . i did n't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference . i do n't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens , you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears . when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid 's , whether it 's divorce or starting a new life afterward , kids will suffer . i do n't like ' studies ' like this , they 're misleading and potentially damaging .

i 've seen and heard sheryl live when she 's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs . she 's great - she 's hip , self-assured and kicks butt ! but here , she tells the audience in " leaving las vegas " : " i 'm playing central park tonight.. . but i have some friends coming up so can you be patient...please ? for lil ' ol ' me ? be very patient... . " almost begging the audience not to walk out while she 's singing solo . it 's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the " friends " arrive . the irony is that sheryl solo is the best part of the album . with the others on board , we ca n't see what sheryl can do , and those familiar with her know that sheryl is capable of a lot . she 's overwhelmed by keith richard , stevie nicks , eric clapton , chrissie hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature . her songs " it do n't hurt " and " there goes the neighborhood " stand out on the album showing that sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her " friends . " too bad she did n't include " am i getting through " - - the part 2 of that was a great rock moment . natalie maines ' grating voice ( like fingernails on a chalkboard ) completely ruin " strong enough . " chrissie sounds like a zombie on " if it makes you happy " , sarah mclaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her lilith-fair mode that she adds nothing to " a difficult kind " ...in fact , by the end of the song sarah seems to disappear from the song as sheryl belts it to the end . that 's sheryl 's song and should remain so , tombstone blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of " all i wanna do " is the new york audience . happy , white room and gold dust woman are three classic rock standards , so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70 's fm aor radio has heard them ad nauseaum . problem here is that nothing new is added to them , they sound like karaoke versions . despite sheryl 's plea for patience , i was bored with the old-timers.they did n't bring sheryl 's career forward , only backwards

i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder . unfortunately , everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the " ancient " sony . the color is not nearly as sharp , the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long . the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself . the camera 's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer 's editing program . the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack . this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights . it uses a toggle to control the exposure and , while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony , it is adequate . unfortunately , it functions so poorly in low light it would n't provide adequate color in an auditorium . i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony . maybe it 's because the camera is so small it 's hard to keep as stable as the larger sony . video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic 's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony 's digital 8. if you do n't have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera , i 'd recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250. if you do have to have a minidv camera and you wo n't be shooting in bright sunlight , try another brand . this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day . otherwise , i 'll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality

whether william golding deserved nobel prize or not is still a debatable point , but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book , and its name is ` lord of the flies . ' but let 's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one i am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen . even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that . you can interpret the meaning of ` lord of the flies ' but who can really visualize it , or the imaginary conversations of simon for that matter ? the biggest problem of harry hook 's new version is not the changes done to the film . the boys are american military school cadets , using dirty words frequently , but those parts did n't annoy me much . real problem is something more essential to the film , which is storytelling . in short the 1990 film does n't know what it wants to be . on the film 's video cover you can read ( and i quote ) ` this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul . " well , not exactly . for as adventure story it lacks pace ; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing . as allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character . the conflict between ralph and jack should be clearer , and piggy 's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy . and do n't forget simon , who sees things , it is true , but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us . it is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful . it could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop , opposite of optimistic tales of jules verne 's adventure stories . by watching this film you can follow the story of the book , but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it . balthazar getty 's feature film debut . and lewis m. allen , one of the producers of the film , had also produced peter brook version in 1963

here 's a good litmus test to show how good a book like " breathing lessons " is- -nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down . there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret . there are no car chases , explosions , sex scenes ( barely even any kissing ) , or exotic locations . no one changes or has an epiphany . almost nothing happens- -maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all . to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull . heck , if someone told me the plot of this book i 'd think it was really dull too , but i did n't want to put it down . the reason is that maggie and ira are so well-drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know . i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira , that 's how real they seemed to me . i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they do n't seem like characters acting their parts ; they seem like real people . because of this , even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book , i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days . in all honesty , what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i 've ever read about how to write a book . this is purely a character-driven novel with very little " plot " except for the death of maggie 's friend 's husband that gets the ball rolling . everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie 's personality more than any artificially-generated plot twists . it 's hard for me to find any real faults with this book , except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes on too long . some people may call this boring or dull , but i would call it purely exceptional . i loved this book and highly recommend it

" house of mirth " is one of the most depressing movies i 've ever seen . to be clear : i 've seen movies like , oh , say , " schindler 's list , " or " the heart is a lonely hunter " that treat tragic events , either in the macrocosm or the microcosm , that did not leave me depressed . rather , they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think . " house of mirth " deals with tragic themes , including human society 's ability to destroy its own , and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites . it was n't , though , moving or thought provoking . i was n't moved by gillian anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor . i did n't believe gillain anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor . rather , i was bored . i kept wanting the film to go faster . it 's a great irony ; edith wharton 's novels are real page turners . quick , to the point . hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality . " house of mirth " has gorgeous clothing and sets . i did n't care about anybody onscreen , though . i did n't believe anybody onscreen . i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda , and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces , as if to prove these points : people are hypocrites , see ! people are insincere , see ! if a person has any decency at all , that person is destroyed , see ! i would tend to agree with all of the above points . so ... why do i need to watch this movie ? also , as a woman , who , as lily bart was meant to , has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that , i felt that this movie , no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally , betrayed lily bart . lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film . she all but participates in her own destruction . you want , just once , for her to show some initiative , some intelligence , some ability to create her own fate . the film denies her those abilities . in this crippling of lily bart , the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does . movies like " gone with the wind " that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning , and occasionally gaining some power , imo , are much easier to watch . one might argue that such films are not realisitic . i do n't know . even we real-life lily barts have our resources , and our triumphs . and , again , watching lily bart in " house of mirth " slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me . it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine .

i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes , but i have to admit i 'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i 've baked from it so far . i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter . i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture , but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and does n't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter . so i was a little skeptical , and then reading through the recipes , although they are very clearly written , there are n't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes . the book already assumes a level of competence . i made three recipes from the book : the essential chewy sugar cookie , the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie , and the fudgy brownies . all three recipes tasted delicious , so i ca n't complain there , but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes , and both the cookies spread too much - - way too much , and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies . i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results , so right now i 'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up . i think it 's okay for a " base " cookie recipe book , but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients

xitel inport deluxe does what it says it does . you can plug in any rca aux connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer . it 's a good solid product that does what it says it does but instead of focusing on the features like other reviewers i will point out its minor drawbacks . first , audacity , the a free software that is mentioned in the manual has a tendency to freeze up while recording with the unit . however , i do n't know if it will freeze up on your computer . second , if you are thinking about buying this product to turn lps to cds , into most lp players do n't have rca aux plugs and you 'll need to buy an addapter . ( what they do n't tell you in the manual is that if you do this you first need to adjust the volume on the stereo and recorder volume in parallel which is kinda tricky . ) finally , the manual could use more detail because some of the important features were n't mentioned . if you do n't mind these drawbacks , you will be able to have many years of recording pleasure if you buy this product

david bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial . this is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial . a disco-esque record , it 's remembered more fondly than it was received by bowie fans at the time . it has some good moments , but overall the production is just too slick and there 's a dearth of imagination on it - china girl is an old iggy pop song , cat people is just a newer version of a previous single and criminal world is a cover of a song by metro , meaning there 's a grand total of five new songs on it . china girl proves a perfect foil for bowie 's melodramatic vocals , cat people is still great even when smothered in too much production and modern love proves that you 're ( nearly ) always gonna get at least one classic on a bowie album . ironically , while it made him a global megastar , this record also marked the start of bowie 's alarmingly swift fall from grace . if he 'd stuck to the highly original work he 'd churned out before this , he 'd probably have had his moment in the sun anyway.. . and nobody could have accused him of selling out . now , what 's that they say about hindsight

we bought this camera thinking that it would be our do-all " eurocam " for an upcoming trip to europe . it promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip . sadly , the camera is not up to filling this role . we will need to take another camera along with it . however , we will take the v705 for its wide-angle lens , the reason that we picked this model in the first place . it is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review . the need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera . if you do not need a 23mm lens , or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens , then you do not need this otherwise mediocre p&s ( point and shoot ) camera . good : fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens ; the 23mm is the default lens ; rapid start-up time ; internal focus and zoom ; chromatic aberration well controlled ; can use 4gb cards ; freeze-frame and extract any video frame . mediocre : soft images ; perceptible shutter lag ; slow shot-to-shot times ; exposure compensation is easy , but steps are too small for digital , and is reset when camera turned off ; flash does not come close to covering the 23mm ; image numbering basically limited to 4 digits ; flimsy construction ; no manual controls ; no raw format ; no optical viewfinder ; histogram on display , but too small to be useful . bad : the absolute worst menu system to be found on a camera ; excessive and unadjustable jpeg compression ; poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery ; unacceptable visual noise starting at asa-400 ; forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images , with inability to save the individual panoramic shots ; panoramic component images forced to 5mp ; overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image ( even with display on ` bright ' ) ; mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results . synopsis : if you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot , this , and the older v570 , are the only choices . if most of your images are in bright light , the 7mp v705 gives better images . if most images will be in low light , the older , cheaper , 5mp v570 is the better choice . the camera seems very fragile . treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance . if you chose this as your sole camera , you will likely be unhappy with your choice . the only reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens . = = = = = some expanded comments = = = = = twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens . this lens has almost decent optical quality ; though the camera 's processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it . on power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens , which is ideal for us . however , considering that this is truly a specialty lens , it would make more sense that the ` normal ' lens should be the default . best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens . better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens . the camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction . this works fairly well , at the cost of even more image softness , but even-so , barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length . this in-camera correction can be turned off . doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance . however , being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is . the only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as : manual settings , a physically larger sensor chip , raw image files , or , at least , a choice of degree of jpeg compression . at the other end of the camera 's focal length the 114 / 117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion . there are very few circumstances where one would want to use ` digital zoom ' , so , as with all digicams , the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus . after reaching optical zoom limits , one is much better off doing any further ' zooming ' in an editing program . kodak 's advertised " 5x optical zoom " is , at best , misleading . actually , it is just flat out untrue . the camera has two lenses . the only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens , which is not quite 3:1. the wide angle lens has a fixed focal length . ( note , in some places kodak claims 39-114 , in others 39-117 optical zoom . ) also misleading is the claimed " anti-blur technology . " as best i can tell from looking at the images , and at the exif metadata , all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa . certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera . speaking of asa . this is an opportune time to address the camera 's incredibly poor menu system . it is byzantine : being both awkward and time consuming to use . to adduce , ` auto ' asa ranges from 50-200 , to set a faster ( or to lock in at a slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels . to change from ` auto ' to the next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls ! on either of the other two p&ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control . the menu system is next to unusable in the field . still on asa settings , the camera does have sensitivities up to asa / iso 1000 ( though the manual only documents asas up to 800 , 1000 is available on the camera ) . unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime , will never-happen-again moment , then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying . at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5 " . the previous version of this camera , v570 , had only 5mp , but the same sensor size . by increasing the pixel count , but not the physical size of the sensor , the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor . this has happened with many of the current p&s cameras , as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality . my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp , as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact . another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which , when calibrated to the sensor in the camera , allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise . doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10 " prints at asa 800. if one really wants to get carried away , combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography ( where dozens / hundreds / thousands of images are averaged together ) makes 8x10 's at asa 1000 doable . people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak 's target market . back to earth . the v705 's still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p&s cameras . mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression , which is not adjustable ( e.g. ` best ' , ` good ' , etc ) . my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used . this results in small files , with a lot of compression artifact . the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5mb in size , those from another 7mp p&s i have are 5-6mb . my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb . the more the compression , the worse the image . most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point . kodak picks it for you , and picks poorly . the v705 's video performance is very disappointing . it uses mpeg-4 compression , and at very aggressive compression settings . unless it is a video of your baby 's first steps , or aliens landing in the backyard , you will likely find it hard to watch . the total output datastream is about 0.5 mbs . compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs ( total , adding sound , error correction , and time codes , is 36 mbs ) . better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression , but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos . that is the choice that most manufactures have made . as a result , the videos from my other p&ss have about a 2 mbs datastream , and so are of much better quality . the battery . kodak 's claim is 150 still images per charge . i am getting 100-120 , with minimal use of flash and the lcd on ` energy saver' . even 150 would be poor , compared with my other digital p&ss , where i expect at least 200 , and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management . this camera has a proprietary ( and hard to remove ) 720 mah battery . my ( several ) other , p&ss have 790-1120 mah batteries , and , i suspect , more efficient processors . since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle , the battery will likely last most of a day . we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera . though the body is of aluminum , the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two . the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use ; there is no cover for the charge socket . the media door often dislodges open . truly , my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used : that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the ( not included in this model ) " easyshare " dock system . this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory , and the overly aggressive jpeg compression . shutter lag , the bête noire of digital cameras , is very evident with this model . i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter , and the image being recorded . however , based on over 50 years of tripping shutters , it clearly varies , and i estimate is , at best 1 / 4 second , up to a bit over 1 / 2 second . in addition to the shutter lag , there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens . together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment , an active child at a particular instant , or a wary animal almost impossible . the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation / price p&s cameras from other makers . the accompanying ` manual ' is poorly organized , childishly written . " finish reading this book , so you can take and share your best pictures ! " at best , it was written for 8 year olds . the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the ` full manual ' , however the address given is incorrect . when eventually found , the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level . panoramics , one of the advertising points of the camera , are another disappointment . basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in ` panoramic mode ' , each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image , in order to allow alignment . as with most ` panoramic modes ' focus and exposure is locked on the first image . so far , this is all ok ; however , it rapidly goes downhill . first , the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 ( not 7 ) mp . next , the image overlay is so dark that , even with the lcd set at max brightness , it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements . however , it gets worse . the images must be joined in-camera ! the individual images cannot be stored ! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry . aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2 " lcd in the field gives , in spite of the camera 's best efforts , much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger , and higher quality , computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home . the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment , and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills , making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings . of course , my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera , so we will not be dragging it along . you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production . much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved . reading back through this review , i see that it is mostly negative . this makes sense , for , as i disclosed at the beginning , it was my disappointment in this camera 's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place . likely i have said all that needs to be said . so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens . except for this unique lens , the camera 's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p&s cameras currently on the market . if you need a true wide-angle p&s , you need this camera . otherwise forget it

tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient " acetaminophen " . acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain , making it a great headache reliever , or a medication that treats mild strains , sprains , toothaches , etc. it also acts to reduce fever . acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin . one drawback of acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation ( therefore , it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction ) . it has few side-effects . those with liver disease should avoid acetaminophen , as it is hard on the liver . tylenol ( acetaminophen ) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of reye 's syndrome and aspirin in children . tylenol is the manufacturer 's proprietary name for acetaminophen . there is a generic form of acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter , and this version is much cheaper than " tylenol " , and the container usually contains more tablets / pills , etc. the generic form of acetaminophen is just as effective as tylenol , just cheaper priced . sometimes acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action . for example , tylenol pm has diphenhydramine ( the active ingredient in benadryl ) , which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill . diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine , so it work for itching and allergies too . tylenol is packaged in different strengths : extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet , standard ( 325 mg per tablet ) , and children 's dose of 80 mg . tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version , called " extended release " . rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach , the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract . all in all , acetaminophen is a great product . if you want a " name brand " of acetaminophen , tylenol is your brand ( although it will cost more ) . my choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen . jim " konedog " koenig

when my virus protection was about to expire , i was in a quandary . i was n't at all happy with the norton i had purchased last year . and , i was n't especially pleased with the mcafee i had used the year before that . when i checked the local stores , there did n't seem to be anything else to choose from . i checked amazon and found more options , plus plenty of customer comments to help me decide . my son told me that bitdefender had been given the highest rating by consumer reports . that , together with other customer comments on amazon , helped me decide to give it a try . so far , i 'm delighted with its performance . in fact , when i first installed it , it found a virus and some suspicious cookies that norton never caught . it does n't appear to be interferring with my system operations ( unlike norton and mcafee ) , it and does n't constantly interrupt with pop-ups and unnecessary warnings . the best thing is that it gives me two years of protection for the price of one year with the other guys

i was so disappointed in this book . i do n't find a closeness to god in the pages . instead it seems intellectual . it contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with god face to face . even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal god i seek . and though the author 's prayers are included too , i feel the same about them . i expected more from richard j . foster

compared to the first humidifier i got from walmart , this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just perfect . oh , well i just got it yesterday so it 's too early to say perfect , but considering others ' reviews , i am pretty confident that i am gonna love it longer than at the first sight . the only thing is i do n't know where to put it . the power cord has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long . i am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair or chest , or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by surrounded with the emitting mist all the time

but a good debut album . this is when i felt proud knowin ja was from ny . no radio friendly s*** here just street for the most part . but i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you ca n't keep talkin about it , which is why i guess he changed his style . now the subject i wanna hit . has anyone noticed that guy named progressive ? why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture ? and everytime i turn around its some damn rocker / junkie hippie . last time i checked rhythm and melody was part of music . i dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock . i 'm tired of our music bein trashed . you know what im a go trash one of they " artist " right now

all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie . this is a very well made movie , with perfectly competent performances . the tone is quite serious , and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up . but then there are many people who loved titanic , which i found utterly depressing . more to the point , though , who cares about the problems of these rich kids ? not me . the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful . and if you enjoy this film , check out less than zero , another gloomy but solid ( & underrated ) ' 80s film . the worst ' 80s film is bright lights , big city - do n't say i did n't warn you !

one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot 's unfurtunate preducices . but how come you do n't say something like that about o ' henry . we ca n't just stop reading authers because you we do n't like their views . someone calls hemingway looking forward ? if that 's looking forward i'de rather look backward . hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever . most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot . eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past , but towards what we have made out of the present . in name of progress , we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls . to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous , the first draft according to one of eliot 's biographers , was absolutly a expression of relavtism . one critic accused him being a nihilist . on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone , not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe . so it does n't have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets . so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism , we could use more of that . yet what he does n't right he evoces through mode and tone , giving us truly one of the best poems of this , or any other century .

over the years at various jobs , i have seen this flashlight several times . it is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse . it may end up looking beat up and yucky , but they always work , no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it . if you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox , work truck , pick-up glove compartment , etc. , this is the only one you need . if you need a good flashlight at home , and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store , this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy . i finally bought one just for my home , and i am only sorry i did not do this years ago ( i am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox ; i refuse to replace it ) . i like this version because it has a strong magnet , and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck . i also like that it has switch guards , so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath 25# of stuff in your toolbox . one nit-picky complaint . it has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector . however , it comes empty and you have to supply your own , so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight .

i mean come on , who needs 5 blades right ? well , after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the mach iii was over a twin head razor , i decided that $10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so i took the plunge , and to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations . the first thing i noticed was that this new fusion has a more powerful engine than the mach iii . the second thing i found was that this razor gives me a much closer shave than the mach iii , and with very little effort , and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore . and i find this razor to be very comfortable without a single nick that others have complained about . but i do use this razor strictly for my face if you know what i mean . haw haw 5 blade

i read the book and saw the movie , which other than title and major characters , have little in common . i ca n't say i really liked either . the book is a little funnier . my major learning from the whole project was when " who wants to be a millionaire " taught me about " roman a clefs " , of which " devil " is one . perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry , i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that " devil " provides . meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly , editor-in-chief of runway magazine , but somehow she 's never quite devil enough . anne hathaway is passable in her second ( or third ) " made over princess " role . the minor characters , including the wonderful tracie thoms as " best friend " lily , are mostly wasted .

english humor is famous for it 's eccentricities but with the exception of selected monty python you need the english pedigree to really like it . the young ones pick up where monty left off . outrageous , yet real , there is a plot line but it does n't get in the way . it 's a shame there were n't more episodes made... .

i liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times.. . i like to watch any movie that involves gangs ( especially bloods & crips ) so i can learn from them.. . if you 're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies.. . you may not want this one in your collection.. . becuase to me , it does n't show enough bloods & crips in it... . the characters are fictional....there are some minor gangs in it as well called the white fences ( latino / hispanic gang - i 've never heard of this gang , so i do n't know if they are true or not . ) . the actors who play the gang members of the white fences are good actors though.. . i think they are better then don cheadle and wayans who play crip members.. . this movie centers more on white fence and their rivalry w / crips.. . there 's not too much focus on bloods in here.. . it also more focuses on sean penn 's character and robert duvall too ( good cop / bad cop ) , and penn on how he falls in love w / a former gangmember woman in the white fence gang . colors is a good watch...i just wish it had more gang focus in it...and more gang sets ( chapters , i.e. eight tray gangsters , hoover , etc.. . ) if you 're looking for a good gang buy , buy the book " monster " by sanyika shakur a.k.a. monster kody scott , or " do or die " by leon bing . those 2 books far surpasses this movie. .

here 's the good news : i have had many cameras in my life , digital and film , and i have found the z1 to be my favorite . the camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color . my previous camera was a minolta dimage 7 ( $800 ) and i found that this camera 's photo quality was just as good . the best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily . owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life . here 's the bad news : recently my camera broke and when i tried to contact fuji to get a replacement or a repair , the service was terrible . their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support . summary : great camera as long as it does n't break . it 's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get fuji to repair it

impressed with the way it clears out viruses , spyware , and trojans- --i can look at what it 's doing or just let it do it . that all goes well . what i do n't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign-me-in sites and i ca n't figure how to change this . so the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful

the text is ok and the way the story is cut up in frames and assembled is competent , but the drawings are the work of a hack , often tacky and always styleless and garishly colored . the costumes and settings are totally lacking in imagination and carry no semantic weight . the attempts to create a visual equivalent for the musical leitmotifs of the operas are too literal and very much in the spirit of a mechanical translation from opera to comic book . an affront to connoisseurs of either opera or comics or both . only valuable as a kitschy curiosity

the story here dose n't matter . the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending . scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction , meth . quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless . roberts is so gay you want to smack his face . he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity . rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius , a role he plays better than anyone today in film . br
