this is one of the better historical dramas from the 1970s . many are stagey and slow , and while this production of madame bovary is very much constrained to stay indoors , this works to advantage for this story of a woman who feels so trapped by her life and her world . emma bovary is not a very sympathetic creature . she is married to a man who loves her with all his heart , who tries to give her everything she wants , is willing to ruin himself to make her happy , and she still cheats on him and remains miserable . in short , she is selfish and inconsiderate , as ugly inside as she is pretty on the outside . francesca annis plays emma . she is indeed very beautiful . as an actress she often comes across as bright and hard , flirty and flighty , but cold and self satisfied . these qualities , of course , are perfect for this character . here she seems to be more in love with the idea of being in love than actually loving . almost anything to break up the dismal tedium of her life and her disgust with everyone and everything in it . it is very hard for a modern audience to feel sorry for her . her daily trial does not include housework or drudgery , she has maids for that . she is bored because she is useless , she is useless because she is too lazy to seek something meaningful to do ; she wants life to be a party , and resents it when it is not . tom conti plays her devoted husband , who is completely devoid of ambition , in work or society . as an actor , conti often seems to have just woken from a nap , and this dampness is just right for dr. bovary . he too is very lazy in his way , but his seems to stem from ignorance . when contrasted with emma 's willfulness , her husband seems the infinitely better of the two . conti is really fine here as a man completely out of his depth with this racehorse of a wife . in much the same way , while annis is briskly carrying every scene , conti just quietly steals every one of them . a perfect pairing for these roles . all the actors here are top notch , and the casting a bit off beat , which adds to the interest . the costumes , especially emmas , are a luxurious parade of overindulgence . absolutely beautiful . while we as an audience enjoy the parade of finery , we can also see how this wardrobe would drive even the richest man into the poorhouse . the production is topped off with a novel and lovely score of predominantly piano compositions ; pretty and liltling , but melancholy and dissonant . do n't let this one get lost in the shuffle , it is worth seeing .

i am rating this program just one star because i found out after ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders . i did go to the nuance website before ordering . they did n't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard . anyway , if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing , you need the preferred version , not this one .

this book offers more information about santa claus than it does the gods / godesses associated with the winter soltice . the craft projects are cheesey and the recipes terrible . save your money and do a little research yourself and if you want recipes or craft projects pick up one of those special christmas magazines for ideas you can adapt for a pagan holiday theme .

this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details . i 'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions . not so . you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it . if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it , forget it . very disappointing waste of money

worked fine for standard items . did not handle partnership issues completely . would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed ( maybe this is possible , but i did not find this function ) . in general , an easy , straightforward program that gets the job done

i bought one and it worked great . at first it 's hard to manuever because it 's really hot , and the barrel 's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot , but once you get used to it , it does a stellar job of straightening your hair . around 6 months into using the straightner , the machine slowly overheated and died . thinking i had a faulty model , i went out and bought a new one . guess what ? a few months into that one , it ended the same way . so basically , not worth it .

this is my first digital picture frame , so i do not have anything to compare it against . i am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use , and i am happy with the resolution and the picture quality . the only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all , and as one other reviewer noted , i had to learn how to do things by trial and error . i also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images , it is not " saved " to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time . however , i like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next christmas

sandra bullock gives an outstanding and believable performance in the role of angela bennett . in this film she plays the part of a solitary and lonely computer expert . an online hacker friend calls to tell her he 's found an amazing disk and is sending it to her to check out . unfortunately , he 's killed in a plane crash before he can visit her . the disk turns out to have secret government information and is wanted by a terrorist group who plan the downfall of the u.s. government . angela bennett recognizes that the disk is something special and before she really realizes what she has , she finds that she 's being stalked . what happens next is everyone 's worst nightmare . through the miracle of computers , the evil group steal angela 's identify and there are few people to vouch for her . the story quickly turns into a cyber thriller . she tries to get help , but she appears to have no friends and does n't even know her own neighbors . her mother ( diane baker ) is in an institution and is apparently suffering from alzheimer's . her former boyfriend , played by dennis miller does try to help her , but the forces of evil are difficult to hide from . jeremy northam delivers a spine tingling performance as the charming and mysterious jack devlin . a man you really want to trust , but should you ?

my 8-month-old son and i listen to this cd every night , and by the pachelbel canon ( track 7 ) he 's usually sound asleep . it is not all synthesizer . the jacket clearly states that the " music box orchestra " includes flute , piano , cello , percussion , english horn , and oboe . as a musician , i am not offended by the " easy-listening " versions of these classics . in fact , i enjoy them . they introduce my son to the timeless melodies without overstimulating him at bedtime . i find them relaxing too

solid construction , good optics , nice sound . as mentioned by others , the output for the usb transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself...a minor annoyance . all in all , this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for... .

i received my 28-200 yesterday from amazon . having read the customer reviews , i immediately put my rebel xt on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my canon 28-135 is . three shots each at f-stops 5.6 , 11 , and 20 , one set indoors at iso 1600 and the other outdoors at iso 200. focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera , highest jpeg setting . after shooting both series , i compared them fresh out of the camera , side by side . results : the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances . it was visibly sharper at iso 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20 , ( the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10 ) , and at 20 , it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background . the 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise . both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in photoshop . there are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider ; different test scenes conceivably produce different results . my conservative conclusion : the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your canon ( unless you are going to drop $2200 on the l series 28-300 is and carry it ) , and the 28-135 is has no clear sharpness advantage . between these lenses , its a tradeoff- --an extra 65 mm of focal length ( 105 mm after a 1.6 conversion ) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability . both lenses focus quickly and silently , and both lenses produce usable shots .

released by atlantic five years after it appeared in australia , presumably to meet high demand for ac / dc 's music , this international version of " dirty deeds done dirt cheap " is a farce . once again , somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence , and replacing both " r.i.p. ( rock in peace ) " and " jailbreak " , two of the strongest numbers in the album 's aussie version , with t.n.t. 's " rocker " and " love at first feel " , an ok , if not spectacular song . ah , and " problem child " , already featured in atlantic 's version of " let there be rock " , is also included in here . the same song in two different " official albums " . marvelous ! . oh yeah , and somebody hired hipgnosis in order to re-design the front and back covers . that was a cute detail , but the aussie version 's covers ( classic mid 70 's cartoonish artwork ) are far more appealing . who 's to blame for this rip off ? . somebody at atlantic records ? . some members of ac / dc ? . maybe both ? . who cares anyway ? . once again , now that i 've got used to the aussie album , listening back to this " product " feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated , low quality spirits . every enthusiastic record collector knows that both warner music and sony music are serious labels that took , and still take risks , by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will . so , it seems that , with their approval of this re-issue , the surviving members of ac / dc are the ones to blame for this farce to go on , and on , and on ... if this is so ... well ... guys , we , the fans made you filthy rich . we deserve the " real deal " , available worldwide , at a " reasonable price " . i only give this " product " a 2 star rating , just because " love at first feel " remains unreleased in australia . how unusual ! . a final word about this re-issue : i do n't own it . in the words of pete townshend , i " wo n't get fooled again " . in order to get bonus material , you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome internet gimmick . if bon scott ( undisputedly the band 's most uncompromising member ever ) , was still alive , i believe things would be different . by the way , if you are interested in the real stuff , please be so kind as to read my review of " dirty deeds done dirt cheap " ( import ) . other items to be avoided : the skimpy " retrospective " ep " ' 74 jaibreak " , and " bonfire " , a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice , in different versions . none of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of ac / dc 's first four aussie albums

i 'm a huge fan of the pria line , but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy . i do n't hate them , but will not buy them again . the flavor is pretty good though , just not what i was expecting . i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind . thank

i have been working for a major daily newspaper in baltimore for 2 decades . perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography . i have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s . maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography . this may be long - winded , but it 's extensive and can be useful . i received the nikon d2h camera - - 2 bodies total - - over one year ago . i think i got them shortly after the d2h system was released in 2003. since then , i have used them to shoot images of all types - - documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , and dead - of - night - - for the paper i work for . this is the only camera i work with . first , please read the manual . there is a ton of information there , and the information is terrific to begin with . the d2h is highly - configurable , with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use ( resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time , for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera ) . i 'll just punch right in to the way it feels . the camera is a rather heavy beast , and for some , there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day , like i do . but the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through . i 've long since given up using any camera bag . all i have are a fanny pack for a 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt . and the d2h 's hold the 17-35mm nikon and the 80-200mm nikon one - touch or the sigma 120-300mm 2 - touch . shooting is a breeze . the batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge . i have my d2h set on iso 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower iso as often as i can , because the higher isos bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation . just today , i purchased digital noise plug ins for photoshop to limit this , and that 's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at iso 800 and above . i now have little problems with capturing images in even barely - limited lighting . i recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an airbus at 36 , 000 feet over the pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f / 2.8 , and it looks tons better than night shots via the d1h , which lacked the internal digital noise filter . that filter kicks in at around 1 / 2 second and longer exposures , and can make you wait as long as your image you 've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise . when you shoot this way ( and in general ) , do n't simply react by cranking up iso because you will not be happy with your results . the camera can be loud . at over 7 frames per second , it can make you obvious in a quiet room . shooting sensitive situations can be testy , so limit your shooting to single frames . i wish this camera had an option to silence this camera , but since the mirror has to raise and lower , there 's no chance to do this . am i happy with the d2h ? definitely , yes . are there improvements that can be made ? yes . but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks . people have been bailing out of using the nikon system and going canon , which has some incredible gear , i wo n't deny that . but instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment , learn how to use the d2h well and you 'll be much happier than ever . and that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations . for instance , white balance . this can be the best thing for you , or the worst thing you 've ever dealt with , depending upon how you approach it . daylight , grey skies , dusk and dawn are easy , because you can set the camera to daylight , flash , shadow ( for dusk and dawn times ) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark . but the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue / green or orange - red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you do n't properly use white balance . preset white balance is king , here . i can get grey , black and white when i preset in mercury vapor light . and i used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting ca n't figure . there is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well ! if you do this ( and i can go on for miles here ) , you 're on your way . so , with trying this d2h , or considering it , read through some of the digital d2h forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances . generally , those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it . i can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail . when you have decent light , you 'll have a decent image . but when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system , you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable . in closing , i have not been paid by anyone , i have no nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that i 'm giving the d2h credit where it 's long overdue

despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release , i need to be honest and explain why i am giving just one poor star . no , i am not crazy . let me explain my point-of-view , and after that you can decide if this jh album really deserves more stars . just to start , this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band ( ? ) or the musicians thru a solid path . there are tracks played by a duo , trio , 4tt , and sometimes a very loose quintet , and each of these tracks have a different mood , without any presence of a jazz soul , or even a real smell of jazz . maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage / tribute to mr strayhorn , or maybe a recognition for mr henderson value in the 20th century jazz history as one of the most important hard-boppers ever . but the result was very poor . if you really love joe henderson ( as i appreciate ) , try any of his albums from the 60 's ( as a band-leader or as a sideman ) , mainly those from the blue note era . in time : i gave one star , in memory of his brilliant carreer . this particular album deserve zero-star .

we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism . naturally , only time will tell if this is any different , but in the meantime , here 's what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket . much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i 've owned , thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere . the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n't need me to tell you this , right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it does not appear very clear , especially if the subject is not static . however , it is bright and rich in color . 3 ) infolithium - this is sony 's name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately , of course . if use is consistent , will provide you with a good idea . if you use one function then another then another , it tends to vary much more and is not as useful . 4 ) integrated charger / usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer . minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger , though the bright white color is far from a match . the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it . i am not speaking about macros , but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small , near objects , such as coins , stamps , or text . quick focus on objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive , but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice . i do n't know if the battery is universal , but even if it is , it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony 's desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard , but this camera uses the memorystick duo , which is about 1 / 4 or so smaller than the " regular " memorystick . this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless , as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny , thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark . within a few feet is okay , but farther subjects are not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures , meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate . you can certainly take pictures in bursts , but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick . previewing the images is also slow . this is also disappointing , as it 's not faster than my older p52. 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod , you have to mount the camera on the plastic station , then connect the tripod to the plastic dock . this is far from ideal . well , there you have it . the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you , in which case this could be a great value for you . i am certainly happy with it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards , compatibilities , and dubious long-term quality

i 'm not sure what to call this cd other than genius . this was the first cd i 've heard from sonata arctica and it 's still my favorite . i 'm not really really big on power metal / epic metal , but i defintely enjoy sa and kamelot . with that said , i think this cd can even entertain those not interested in power metal . my friend enjors radio rock and rap , but after hearing me play this cd where we work , he begged me to make him a copy . towards the actual cd , i 'm not quite sure i can put what 's in it into words . songs like silver tongue and broken have a very distinct , unique sound . the ballads , draw me and the misery are both superb efforts , each making the listener feel tony kakko 's pain . my favorite song would have to be a dead heat between the misery and gravenimage . the keyboardist in this band works in overdrive in each song . he plays fast , and keeps the melody in each beautiful and interesting ( and lighthearted at times ) . the guitarist plays very fast when he needs to , and the right power chords other times . he 's quite good . overall , the sound they eminate is as uplifting as it is rocking . they do a great job . the lyrics seem much better than older releases ( english lessons ? ) but still can be a bit odd . " ...with long haired drummer in band " springs to mind . still at least they write about mundane things.. . i love kamelot , but the knight in shining armor routine will get old eventually . anyway , the vocals are very well done , he obviously quite talented and the band harmonizes quite well , too . ( they 'd make queen jealous ! ) overall , i ca n't praise this cd enough . every song is an adventure , none of them a tedious or unnecessary one at that . i would say that anyone could enjoy this cd , but i 'd first recommend it to those who are tired of the american screamfest metal that 's going on today . then i 'd recommend it to power metal fans , and so on . simply put , this is one of the best cds i own . give it a chance

im going to rate this product a 2 because i like it but i would change a few things if i could . it does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff . the couple of things i would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord , you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds , then you have to stop and click play again . i wish there was an option where you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again . the other thing is something a little more important . the product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play , its called olga . well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore . so you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the beetles or metalica or the grateful dead or anyone else , and thats what they advertise " play hit songs " . so overall , knowing all this i would have shopped around more . especially for the price , its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs .

very convenient reading glasses . you could hang them on your neck when not using them , and not even notice they are there . they are very sturdy , and are flexible making them almost imposible to break . cons : both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side . they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face . the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair , as the glasses would trap your hair against your face

git-r-done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as larry the cable guy . larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head , but end up doubling you over with laughter . his preformance will definitely torque your brain , so be prepared . there are a couple instances where larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure . one such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun . i was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that larry was just messing with me because we all know girls do n't fart , they do n't even have buttholes . he then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out ever . unless you are an idiot , you know you ca n't look like him without a strict training regiment , nice try larry . he finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti-hillary clinton piece . this was the icing on the cake for me because when i think of intelligent political commentary , i think larry the cable guy ! ! ! !

i saw transamerica months ago and i still think about it . there are many reasons , most obviously felicity huffman 's portrayal of bree , a man determined to become a woman , trying to close the door on his past , just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child . but transamerica also brings a funny , poignant , and at times visually beautiful road trip across the united states , in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles , let alone 3000. it brings unexpected and uncertain romance . it brings out humanity in all its characters ( save one minor one ) , including bree 's bitter mother . finally , it - - plot spoiler here - - concludes with tentative reconciliation , acceptance , and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future . transamerica is not loud , not big budget , not spectacular , but there are few movies near as good as it .

i saw this thai horror film about 3 years ago . i have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from thailand , and i have seen a fair share of them ( nang nak , the sisters , mae nak , art of the devil series ) . the film focuses on tun and his girlfriend jane . tun , a photographer reunites with his old friends . on the way home , they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on , tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them . ok , i am not spoiling anything , the story is more complex than it sounds . tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them , with jane caught in the middle . as usual , there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people . " shutter " refers to his camera and what it represents . " sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones. . " i 'm stopping here , i do n't want to give out anymore . the plot is not that complex , but believe me when i say , the film is well-made . it does a great job of putting things together , each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present . i did n't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric , creepy feel to it . also , there is a scene in the movie that tun and jane looked at actual photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid . honestly , this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the " shock ending " has the greatest twist of any horror flick i 've seen ! i 've seen a lot of horror films , only the exorcist and the omen ever scared / creeped me out , and shutter came very close . my female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place . since i have n't seen the tartan release and i only own the region-3 dts-es rlease from panmedia ( hong kong ) but tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the hong kong or korean versions . the video is sufficient , with some dark and bright contrast . it is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel . the dts soundtrack is great though , very crisp and loud . the english subtitles are excellent , the thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen . a definite must-see if you are a fan of asian horror or horror films in general . it rivals ringu , one missed call and the original ju-on 1 and 2. four and 1 / 2 stars !

i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist - up - and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat

when one begins to despair about the quality ( or lack thereof ) of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being . not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over 240 pages one that i finished all too quickly . i could not get enough of it . the narrator and main character of the novel is a mr. stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly . his employer , a lord darlington , is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the germans . and what did mr. stevens think of this ? he did n't , he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate . there is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in mr. stevens . you 'll have to read the book if you want to know more . i read mainly victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not . if you get this book you will not be sorry .

i want the two hours of my life back ! after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is ! what a waste of time ! maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in 1973. that time is past ( even then , the " robots attack people " concept was hardly new ) . now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action . this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes . unless you are doing a research paper on american sci-fi cinema , or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid , or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies , avoid this dull piece of drivel . i feel cheated !

synopsis ( including ending ) : don ameche ( gino ) , a chicago shoe shine man , is approached by the mafia to go to jail for " 3 to 5 years " to take the place of their mafia boss accused of murder because he bears a striking resemblance to him . they 'll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong dream of fishing on a boat . joe mantegna ( jerry ) takes don ameche ( gino ) on a 3 day vacation to satisfy his every wish before he 's incarcerated . joe mantegna is on probation from the mob , after disobeying orders from a previous job . joe mantegna goes " outside channels " to take don ameche ( gino ) to lake tahoe to the " galaxy " hotel where they stay , wine and dine , and try to have a good time . things turn difficult when a local real mafia boss brings don ameche ( gino ) to his house as a guest and they form a bond . the real mafia boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and don ameche and joe mantegna are caught in the middle . they escape the gathering and on the day don ameche is brought back to chicago , joe mantegna is ordered to kill don ameche and make it look like a suicide . " it 's cleaner this way.. . " , he 's told . joe mantegna refuses the order , and the film ends with a mafia employee testifying in court and getting sentenced to jail for 20 years to life . the good : joe mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in the real mafia boss in lake tahoe . other than that , there 's nothing else going for this one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge . the bad : the mob wants tough guys , right ? this is a comedy , right ? no ones a tough guy and there 's no laughs . joe mantegna plays a sissy instead of a mafia tough guy . don ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality . i wanted to like this film but i coulde n't because it was very slow , very boring and none of the characters were interesting . we never have a scene with the real mafia boss that looks like don amecha and the two never meet . you would expect a friendly " thanks for going to jail for 3 to 5 years for me " but it does n't happen . at the end someone for the mob is dressed up like the real mafia boss and he 's testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail . he does n't look anything like don ameche or the real mafia boss and yet , he 's right there taking the fall . if the film did n't need to depend on don ameche 's appearance , why did n't they send him to jail from the beginning ? the worst david mamet experience i 've had . very surprising stinker . the characters : if don ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting . if joe mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them , he would have been more interesting . as the film stands , they 're both flat . don ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other characters used . when a character says something , you can be sure don ameche repeats it 30 minutes later like a senile robot . don ameche 's dialogue leaves a lot to be desired . add to that his boring and stale acting in this film . he played very dumb , not interesting , like a real man in crisis about to go to jail for money . overall , joe mantegna was not believable as a mafia hired hand . don ameche was too passive and uninteresting , and joe mantegna is too passive and stale . scene criticism : a couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic . ( gas station scene where joe mantegna is given $3 more in gas than he asked for ) joe mantegna is working for the mob , and he asks for $1 of gas , and gets $4. he does n't have the cash to pay , and when the gas attendant takes the car keys his reaction is " please , please , please " a real mob guy would punch the gas attendant , take back the keys , and leave for the plane they were late for . a mob guy that wo n't defend himself for $3 ? ( scene with don ameche offered money to go to jail for 3 to 5 years ) don ameche does n't put up a fight or try to leave the room , and is too passive . we do n't learn about his past or his life or family . there 's not enough time spent on the offer , and the scene was over valued for it 's lasting value . ( bedroom scene with joe mantegna trying to let don ameche escape ) joe mantegna had no real connection to don ameche 's character to justify the scene . instead it 's 2 strangers . personal commentary : the test for a comedy for me is - " how many times did i laugh ? " this film never made me laugh . i 'm shocked the film costs $24.99 on dvd . rent it instead . it belongs in the $1 bin at wal-mart . writing criticism : lines like " he 's the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the guy " and lines like " a big man knows the value of a small coin " and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense . the writing is drivel . alternative recommended film : " trading places " with dan aykroyd and eddie murphy and also don ameche , albeit in a smaller role

when i first saw this album i thought " heavy d....without the boyz ? ! that ca n't be a good thing . " here 's the problem with this album : heavy d took the " jiggy " route . when i heard " big daddy " for the first time , i thought it was pretty tight and that it had that heavy d feel to it . so after hearing that , i went and copped the disc . when i got home and read the liner notes , my jaw hit the floor . there was heavy d....smoking cigars , iced out , and playing the big willie role ( the popular theme for the " jiggy " crowd in ' 97 ) . at that point , i realized that original mcs were quickly becoming extinct . after years of success with his group , heavy d had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time . that might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent . there are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen . there 's a lot of lazy and predictable production ( we 're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking ) . on " i 'll do anything " heavy d and tony dofat completely jacked hall & oates for their tune " i ca n't go for that ( no can do ) " and it only gets worse throughout the album ( i wo n't even get into how the gap band 's " yearnin ' for your love " was abused on " keep it comin ' " ) . there are n't enough good songs on this album to make heavy 's change of heart seem very believable . avoid this album y'all . it 's not completely terrible , but it comes dangerously close . there are songs that border on wack and there are songs that are completely wack . sadly enough , this can be said for the majority of the songs on this album . i was very disappointed in heavy d and lost a little respect for him after hearing this . i can only reccomend buying this if you can find it used for less than $3.00. otherwise , avoid at all costs . standout tracks : big daddy ( my favorite ) and " you can get it " feat . the lost boyz & soul for rea

no use thumbing the pages of cale 's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography , ' what 's welsh for zen ? , to glean hard data on this one melodic gem . coming after the heady , if problematic days of the velvets , there 's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format . the abrasive thrashing rock of ' mcbeth ' ( while indicating his imminent direction ) serves the one discordant note . throughout , cale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past . language had been severed from lineal meaning , in rock , since bob went electric . pete brown writing for jack bruce 's towering masterpieces , ' songs for a sailor ' , & ' harmony row ' ; keith reid with procul harum , were mixing up the lyric medicine , presumably with other pharmacuticals & making sumptuous music on a par with ' paris 1919' . that date ? the birth of surrealism , ( and similar writing to cale 's efforts herein ) perhaps ? the russian revolution ? cale 's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it , which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs ; stretched out vowells on , ' planing lakes ' , ' elephants that sing ' , ' looking out from here at half past france . ' it was far from banal music , however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings , viola & piano cale painted . these lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung . ' locusts ' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness .

the first version of easy cd creator i used was cd creator 4 basic . it was okay , pretty much what it said it was : basic . i got the upgrade to that from an ebay auction and it worked pretty good . later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new cdrw drives in good old version 4 , i upgraded to cd creator 5 platinum ( the version being sold here . ) this too worked pretty good - for a little while . then the operation was moved over from adaptec to roxio , and from that point onward , things have been more thorny than rosy . roxio will require you to register the product in order to download the ( one ) utterly essential update to keep this thing running . perhaps you do n't mind that , but i feel it 's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy . plus you have to keep track of your password to the website and if you change isp 's you will have to re-register . a hassle to say the least . also , since roxio took the reins , there are no further updates being provided . instead roxio tries to " encourage " ( read " browbeat " ) you into getting the software upgrade for even more money . this upgrade will not work on win98se , which i still use for various reasons . so if i were to upgrade the software again , i would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that i need and still use . if you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making , i applaud you . i prefer to keep a little cash for retirement . it is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form , and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face , such as getting " illegal request " errors from direct cd , or inability to format or erase cdrw 's that was once possible in version 4. also , any cdrw 's created in version 4 may not be readable with the new software , or at the least there are some technical issues with this . at any rate , it is not neccessarily all that " easy " unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand ( or are willing to learn ) some of the finer technical points in cd recording technology . i prefer not to be bothered with it , i just want to create some cds . i now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all , especially direct cd , a program that originally provided the ability to do " drag and drop " writing of files to a read / write cd . now i find that direct cd is non-functional , and the only cd 's i can write are cdr 's , and there are problems growing in that area as well . speed of the cdrw or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue . the software simply refuses to work as it once did . it should n't be called " easy cd creator " . perhaps " irritating " cd creator would be more appropriate . in summary : this does not deserve stars . perhaps a few " black holes " ? while i once would have given wholehearted supported this product , regrettably i cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now .

the next generation is basically a remake of the original texas chainsaw massacre , in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical , though different characters and locations are used . the original was a little overrated in my opinion and this " remake " is quite frankly terrible . bad acting with the exception of renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several b movie actors . the only major differences from the original are that leatherface now dresses as a woman , which was fairly amusing but hardly essential , and a tacked on conspiracy theory . the conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous , i wo n't explain it , theres no point , watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends . i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though , even die hards admit its awful , i only gave it 2 stars because i reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst ( yes even worse than this ! )

when i 1st watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary . to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime . this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people . the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing . also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered . this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each / husband killing wife after wife / a man who enjoys murder / and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other . i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it . if you do n't heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny ( i would n't take it for free )

this was the break through record for pink floyd that would place them in the super-league . the strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and dave gilmore 's guitar playing and voice is superb . production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential . overall the record works well as a whole yet i do feel ' money ' seems out of place . the problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption . now do n't get me wrong i think this is a magnificent record but is it really pink floyd 's greatest album , i tend to think not . is it the greatest record of all time ? most certainly not . because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great . because everybody and their grandmother thinks it 's great , does not necessarily make it great . the problem with this record is that it sounds of its time , not that that 's a bad thing , its just that it does not transcend time . the real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it . i ca n't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive . some records released at the same time : can 's " future days " ( 1973 ) ; nue ! ' s " 2 " ( 1973 ) ; king crimson 's " larks ' tongues in aspic " ( 1973 ) ; robert wyatt 's " rock bottom " ( 1974 ) ; tangerine dream 's " phaedra " ( 1974 ) are by far more influential and enduring than dark side . if you do n't own dark side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars , but make sure you buy ' piper at the gates of dawn ' also . ' piper ' is floyds greatest , most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time . besides , how many people who think ' dark side ' is floyd 's best have actually heard ' piper' .

this uv filter does it job to protect the lens well . the build is solid ( metal construction ) . the glass is also descent quality . about the performance , it absorbs some uv light . the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable , probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me . now , about the one problem which is the internal reflection . i 've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light / night situation . the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong / bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure ( the surrounding environment ) . to put it in example ( which hopefully is easier to understand ) , when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection . as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides / corner of the picture ( and not in the center of the picture ) , the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear ( if you move the light far enough from the center ) . and if the light is n't too bright / contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection . but of course most of the time , a lamp at nightime is often very bright . but the point that i 'm trying to make is that the internal reflection does n't happen all the time during low light or night time . additionally , the internal reflection is n't only happening at night . it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example . basically same rule as above , on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area , and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side / dissapear ( also depending the angle ) . but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation ( which is not hard to do ) . i 'm actually not a fan of lens filter ( any filter ) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object , but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens . and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you do n't have any filter for your lens yet .

i 've been very critical of the fiction work of john grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting . well , he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting , if not spectacular non-fiction work of the trials and tribulations of ronald williamson , a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row . i wo n't go into the details of williamson 's ordeal , but i will say that grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried book , that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers , but is still interesting nonetheless . he does a good job giving the details of ron 's case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and ron suffered from growing mental issues . grisham did n't even think about writing ron 's story until after ron passed away , so there are no interviews to draw upon , but he does a decent job of tying it all together . i will also say that although he is anti-death penalty , he does n't hammer that opinion at you . he lets the story itself do the talking . i 'm actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of grisham 's next novel , as he 'll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time . hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like " the firm " or " a time to kill " , not dreck like " the king of torts "

before buying , i downloaded and installed a 30-day trial version of kis 6.0. first , i uninstalled windows live one care . after installing kis 6.0 and rebooting , my windows xp home edition computer just locked up . had to go through safe mode to remove the program via windows explorer , since add / remove programs in control panel will not work in safe mode . when i reinstalled windows live one care , it offered to remove the remains of kis 6.0 that i couldn't . next , internet explorer 7 would not work at some sites . had to call microsoft support and a great technician in india took about an hour to straighten out the damaged files in ie7 at no charge . thanks a lot , kaspersky ! now , my computer is working fine . i am sorry that i did not have a chance to use kis 6.0 , but i will stick with one care and renew it when my 1st year of free updates expires soon

the remix is totally devoid of any taste:first the vocals are completely-off ; the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings . secondly , there is absolutely no respect on part of the " mixing djs " for the great vocalists:there is no melody and absolutely no ' jelling-together ' of the music with the vocals . i was deeply disappointed with this cd.if you are into remixes get the rod stewart " do ya think i am sexy " single cd instead

my objection was the implication that the " stars " played a part in the film . i felt that the picture was completely deceptive . ms richards and ms hanna had less than 15 minutes ( maybe a little more but not much and possible even less ) and were clearly there to fool the viewer . it was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary

it seems to me there 's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era . i 'm not arguing it 's either better or worse than others , it just feels different and very distinctive . in this light , " wall street " reminded me vividly of " no way out " for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several de palma films . do n't ask me why . it just does . useless considerations apart , " wall street " , directed by always controversial oliver stone , pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away . they always burn out , in a snap of fingers . and bigger they are , harder they fall , right ? the story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen , featuring a bright young " sport " , bud fox ( played by charlie sheen ) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life . he wants more , and hotshot gordon gekko ( michael douglas ) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful , vicious , influential and a sure winner . by sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence , bud sneaks into gekko 's office and tries to prove his value to him . from here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young protegé who rises to the top at breakneck speed until , unexpectedly , something shatters his bond to the master . something that hits home and makes bud question his beliefs . what this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie , so i 'll let that for you to find out if you did n't see it yet . all the acting is quite superb , especially the relationship between gekko and fox . martin sheen - who is charlie sheen 's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work , not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down . he reminds me of donald sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he 's on screen a couple of minutes at a time . if you like high finance intrigue , big guys pulling the strings on each other , twists and turns , then " wall street " is probably essential . and it will probably give you an excuse to read sun tzu 's " the art of war "

office 2007 is a nice step up from office 2003 ( and earlier ) as it has better visuals on the toolbar . e.g. instead of just seeing the worded commands on the toolbar where one clicks on the command and then gets a drop down list to choose from with more commands , i.e. file , tools , edit , etc , you 'll see tabs with different commands on the toolbar . when clicking on the tabs , it sets up across the toolbar , all of the functions of that particular tab . once viewed , you not only see the words of the functions , but also , small example graphs and images of what that functions does . this only applies to all the applications other than outlook , which pretty much retained the same look and feel as 2003 the load times seem to be much quicker than what i had in the 2003 version . in outlook , setting up accounts , maintaining names and addresses is much easier too . the only annoying part of office 2007 that comes to mind is , one can only choose from 3 color schemes . the three are " black " which really looks more like a dark taupe or slate color , " blue " which looks more like a light powder blue and " silver " , which looks like a light gray . in my honest opinion , i like having the standard color look like previous versions and as my taste goes with this , i only like the black setup only

i travel 2-3 weeks a month for work and i needed a hairdryer that was better than the 1000 watt hotel dryers , so after some research i decided to purchase the travel-size t3. during the first time i used it , it started smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire . ( there were actual flames - - although they quickly burned out ) i took the dryer back to sephora and i was quickly given a replacement . while i had dryer #2 , i noticed that it took 15-20 minutes to dry my hair , when it usually takes 20-30. however , i have the full size t3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when i use that one . i was expecting this to offer the same power as the other t3. the bottom line is that i did n't notice a big difference between the travel t3 and the hotel hairdryers that are built into the bathrooms . after 6 months , the handle broke on the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use . if you want a great hairdryer , buy a full size t3 , elchim or chi pro - - if you need something to travel with , you 're better off with finding space for the full size model .

i am a br5-49 aficionado from the early days at robert 's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks . admittedly , i long for those days as much as i long for stirrups in major league baseball . so i 'm nostalgic , " it 's a free country . " it is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels . yet , whenever i read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has " matured , " i can do nothing but cringe . here 's the flowchart : band starts out - band plays hard - band gets cult following - band gets reputation - band strikes out on road - band gets contract - band gets a little more pub . - band gets contract with bigger label - band gets new management supplied by label - band gets " coached " in next recording - band changes faces along the way - band changes label again - band gets new direction from new label - band fights for identity - band produces new " mature " album - band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process . gee , i sure hope this is n't how the end of br5-49 comes about , but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion . this record is ok . of course , i realize that any band ca n't just re-hash the same ' ol stuff on every album , but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl . one part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals , and a simple taste of this is what i sorely miss in the last few recordings . this band live used to be a wild , jittery , moving organism on stage , and although they are still a solid live show ( saw them on the last tour at poor david 's pub in dallas ) , something has settled down . chuck is a great talent , but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of chuck and gary bennett . ok , i 'll go cry me a river , but dammit , just go listen to the big backyard beat show one more time . mature ? i just do n't want to grow up that bad

there is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from how to cook without a book : recipes and techniques every cook should know by heart , by pam anderson ( not the big-breasted one ) , and that is the art of the highly marketable title . for starters , this artful moniker really plays on the single gal 's fears about never being able to put together nutritious , attractive , varied , affordable , and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week . you want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world . so the plus side of this book is the title . that 's where it ends . the big idea here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook by : a ) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation , and b ) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques . sounds interesting so far , right ? well , the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on " canned low-sodium chicken broth " , which i think is a bit of a weird ingredient . it 's even included in the salad dressings . other big hitters include : heavy cream , butter , and sour cream . do people really eat like this ? regularly ? why not make the easy fruit parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal ? just take a tall glass , drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream , then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar , and some berries . repeat until the glass is filled . crikey . sour cream , brown sugar , and berries ? ! ? would n't it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of greek honey ? am i totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing ? or , if calories are no object anyway , why not pick up some baskin robbins ' rocky road on the way home from work ? that 's easy and it 's worth the internal havoc it will cause . oh , and here 's a sample mnemonic device that i ca n't not share , it 's that good : " cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil , then toss in some pasta that 's fresh from the boil .

after reading the great reviews regarding the vct870rm tripod ( here and elsewhere ) , i decided to purchase one for my sony hdr-hc1 camcorder . when i first opened the box , the vct870rm seemed sturdy and well made . the tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch , and the remote controls on the handle worked well . however , the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan , the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly . it felt like the tension control knob was tightened , but that was not the case . in fact , the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed . i recently found a vct870rm review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning . however , due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod , i 'm assuming that i just received a bad one . i 'm now in the process of working with amazon to get a replacement sent to me . so far , amazon has been great , as they 've already scheduled ups to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day . they say that i 'll receive my new tripod next week . i 'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives . update : i received a new replacement vct870rm tripod from amazon , and this one works great . panning and tilting are both very smooth , and the tension is adjustable . if i 'd have received this tripod originally , i would 've given it 5 stars . the first vct870rm i received was definitely defective . i 'm glad i returned it , and i 'm glad i bought it through amazon ( best price at the time , and a hassle-free return )

" learn to fly , " the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio , may as well have been written by the outfield or some other average rock band along those lines . i almost gave this album two stars , but unfortunately i think that rating would be just too generous . foo fighters have made some really good songs , like " everlong .

renowned artist and tarot scholar / writer robert m. place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book , the buddha tarot companion : a mandala of cards . this book affords a rich unique perspective of the tarot through the lens of the buddhist paradigm . the companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand , a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions , " embellish this box with protective and / or empowering symbols . " other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the buddha cards include : " smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading . " and " store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy , promote healing , or provide protective energy . " also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards . both items are published by llewellyn , who as always , have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented . robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the buddha with the tarot journey through the cards . he describes how the major arcana fits perfectly with the life of siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment . each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic 's journey to enlightenment . in fact , it is mr. place 's belief that the creators of the tarot were directly influenced by the life of the buddha , and incorporated archetypes into the major arcana based on his journey . he teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another . instead , " the classical world maintained communications with india and the ancient western philosophers were familar with indian philosophies . " as well , the islamic world introduced the christians to the life of the buddha during the middle ages . " the european christians were enamored with the story , and they transformed him into a christian saint - st. josaphat . " i was fascinated by the titles given to the major arcana cards . each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the siddhartha 's personal journey to become the enlightened one , the buddha . robert place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice eastern beliefs . he also acts as a mediator to help people of the western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of buddhism and its teachings for life . i highly recommend this deck - i found it very easy to follow , the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to " read " using a buddhist world view .

i purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend . i will start out by saying that when i first purchased this frame , i loved it . the display , contrast and brightness were great . however , after 5 short months , the display 's pixels started acting funny . they get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage . turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it 's back to bad pixels . myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue . in conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons .

watching the melvins evolve was extremely interesting and entertaining . they began as an unassuming punk band , and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70 's rock into their sound . then they stripped away any and all of the " punk " trappings and went for pure heavy . it all culminated with this record . it just does n't get any heavier than ' roman bird dog / hung bunny' . ' with teeth ' , rumored to actually be written by joe preston , is one of my all time favorite melvins songs . speaking of joe preston , he was the by far best of the melvins ' 7000+ bassists they had over the years . shame they got rid of him shortly after this album . as soon as they fired him , they went straight down the greased pole to mediocrity hell . bad karma . thank god that rock bands record their music so that it is n't lost forever every time they make stupid decisions . the only song on this record which i do n't like is the cover of alice cooper 's ' the ballad of dwight fry' . thankfully they made up for it with a cover of flipper 's ' sacrifice' . some of the melvins ' subsequent records have their moments ( stoner witch 's ' shevil ' , stag 's ' cotton mouth ' ) , but for the most part it seems to me that the melvins gave up the ghost after recording this . maybe someday they 'll make a comeback

dr. hawkins first book , power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology . however , he began to venture into misapplication of this method , and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity , concept , or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement . there are serious logical , philosophical , and practical flaws in his work , and his attempt to quantify matters that are n't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests . this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques . the actual technique is worthwhile , but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid . the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate , valid answers . hawkins explores issues about media , politics , religion , spirituality , history , philosophies , healing arts , entertainment , and more , and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters . he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters , liars , and two-faced sociopaths . he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists , many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and do n't resort to hawkins ' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth . hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method , as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology , but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod . i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful , responsible work in those areas . for now i 'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job , many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds , and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world

i read an interview with mr. vollman , i think a couple years ago , i ca n't quote directly but he said he thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people . they save marriages , they provide comfort to the loneliest , most desperate among us . in practically the same breath he observed that they spread disease and sometimes rob their johns . that kind of duality is at the heart of much of vollman 's writing . on the surface , whores for gloria is one desperate , delusional man , so eager for even the illusion of relatedness that he attempts to recreate gloria with bits and pieces of other prostitutes . it is n't fully clear if gloria herself was ever real , but regardless , it is now a quest to fill that void collage style with physical samples , such as hair clippings , as well as emotional artifacts . the most poignant scene may be the protagonist hiring a prostitute , and wanting nothing more than to hear happy childhood memories . the prostitute complies as best she can but , story after story , the narratives veer into disturbing material . the hardest thing for the human to do is to hold opposite opinions about one thing at the same time . the more intelligent and observant one is , the more painfully aware of the absurdity of this task , the more painfully aware of the mental contortions necessary to maintain the illusion of meaning . this is where the magic lies in true artistc genius , such as a thelonius monk solo or , in this case , vollman 's writing . i 've never read anything that better communicates simultaneous beauty and ugliness . and no better forum than gutter sex , which vollman renders both repulsive and compelling . and he does n't do it by being overly clever . he does it through the chaos of brute honesty . whatever compositional gymnastics go into the writing , the end product is very readable and deceptively simple

actually i felt i was in love with this film as soon as i saw the very beginning - the opening credits against the background of chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music . " candyman " could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense , but bernard rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant , enchanting and spellbinding film out of it . if you 're interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you wo n't find it here ( you will , but not in quantities you used to ) . " candyman " is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what 's important , where mood is what matters , where you are given some food for thought . i do n't have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film , i can only say it 's a great achievement of bernard rose as a director besides i guess tony todd , virginia madsen and xander berkeley had their best roles played in this feature . i do n't personally think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre , but " candyman " is a true gem which would n't be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times . by the way if you do n't want to spoil your impression of the film , better do n't watch " candyman " parts 2 and 3. they are the average tenage urban legend flicks .

anyone who reads this book would not be surprised at the runaway success of the & quot ; left behind&quot ; series , since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture . indeed , the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the reagan white house . and , christian or not , who has n't heard of the term & quot ; antichrist&quot ; or the significance of the number & quot ; 666&quot ; ? this book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology , including the role of israel , russia , the arab countries , europe , and the united states . it also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years ( turkey was considered gog and magog before russia was , and the pope was designated as the antichrist for years before hitler and henry kissinger came along ) . the final chapter , written at the brink of the collapse of the soviet union , demonstrates how , once again , premillenial thought adjusts itself ( or sometimes not ) depending upon world conditions . this is a fair , even-handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon

this lens does exactly what it should . the overall quality is extremely good . take a look at my photos : - first photo is without the lens - second photo is with the lens and flash - third photo is with the lens and without flash there are a few things to note about the photos : - there is a substantial amount of barrel distortion . this is normal . try not to have straight lines near the borders of the photo to make it less obvious . - fringing is exaggerated . you notice fringing ( purple or blue tints ) along high contrast edges of objects that are near the borders . you can see this on regular shots but is more exaggerated with the wide angle lens . - the lens makes a shadow when using the built-in flash . you can see the shadow in the photo with the flash . in a darker environment , it is very obvious . the external flash is the only way to fix this . a couple details : - you can get an extender that is a nice brushed aluminum here : http : / / www.lensmateonline.com / s2.html - the camera has a setting ( converter ) to indicate that you have the lens attached . it 's not obvious what it does but it is indicated by a change in the image stabilization icon so i assume that it affects the way that image stabilization works . overall , i recommend this lens

the story is about peter growing up with his family in north dublin and is set in the 1960's . the tightly knit family relations with his own family and those of his extended family of lodgers , which his parents took in to supplement his father 's income , forms the backdrop to his story at 44 seville place . the pace of the book has the rhythm of the sixties . the short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties and keeps the tempo up-beat throughout the whole of the book . for those who have experienced dublin in the sixties this book will take you back to that place and that time . the metaphorical pieces were very touching and masterfully executed . one example of this technique was when peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother frankie before frankie goes into surgery . a joy to read . da is the sun and all the minor planets revolve around him . peter takes to his role as mercury the messenger with great relish . there is a strong bond between father and son . i feel this story should not be compared to frank mccourt 's angela 's ashes . a one generation step into the future in ireland can make a very big difference in how life is experienced . it was a very enjoyable read whereby the need to laugh out loud in places could not be silenced . however there were places in the book where the need to cry out loud could also not be silenced .

having used the office programs for some time , i was a bit put off by the new ribbons which replace the old menus . i guess that office needed a new look , but i am not sure if i buy the advertising that the ribbon will make my work more productive . some things that you should know about office 2007 and ultimate in general . the licensing agreement allows you to install office 2007 ultimate on two computers , one of them being a laptop . i found this clause in the legal agreement and even called microsoft legal to confirm . if you make modifications to the quick access toolbar ( and who wo n't do that ? ) and you want to take these changes with you to another computer , the files for the toolbars are located at : c: \documents and settings\username\local settings\application data\microsoft\office where username is your username . something i have found handy when working with my two computers . one thing that i do n't like is that the file name extensions have changed . gone is the familiar .doc for word documents . now the file extension is .docx . if you want to create a document that can still be opened by prior versions of word , you must purposefully choose to create a .doc file , but you lose some of the functionality of the new files . the .docx file this format is not the same as the opendocument standard . microsoft promises that older versions of word can still open the .docx files , but i have not tried it and i do n't buy into everything that microsoft promises until i see it happen . why could n't microsoft just leave the files the same as they have always been ? office 2007 does look slick and i anticipate that i will warm up to it in the future as i get used to the new command structure .

these are my experiences with the extender mounted to my eos 10d . i 'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30d , but it looks like i do n't want to risk wasting my money . let me explain : let me start by saying that the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the lcd screen . i shoot events at nightclubs a lot , so i 'm always ( a ) running around to get shots , causing me to sweat , which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and ( b ) i always show the subjects their photos after i take them , so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying . for further clarification , i 'm asian , so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities . i run around a lot when i shoot . so the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off . i got lucky once , and found it in the general vicinity of where i was , but the second time , i was n't so lucky . so what did i do ? i purchased another one . not only did i have to purchase the extender , i had to purchase the viewfinder replacement ( the piece with the soft rubber ) because that was attached to the lost extender . another 2 weeks in , and again , same problem . i did n't even bother buying any replacements , as by this time , i upgraded to the 30d . if you do n't plan on doing a lot of running around , then this piece may be okay for you . however , please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my canon backpack . for some reason , the piece did n't fit tightly with the mount on the camera . another problem , as most people mentioned , is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender , so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day . i guess i 'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30d ; i 'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10d

this is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish . there are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber . i have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it . i use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography . the quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release . i bought an extra quick release plate so i can switch between two cameras . tilt only - - no swivel : amazon ( and others including bogen ) calls it a swivel tilt head , but that seems to imply that it moves in two directions - - tilting ( up and down ) and swivelling ( side to side or panning ) . this head only moves in the tilting direction which allows you to orient the camera in either landscape or portrait modes . the tilting action could be improved if the head clicked into the upright position when you tilt it back to landscape . when you are going to the portrait mode , there 's no problem since it stops at 90 degrees . however , when i want to go back to landscape , i have to hold it out and look at it to see if it 's level . a subtle click to know i 'm there would be nice

i wanted to buy a compact slim d-camera . those with larger zoom are quite bulky , you ca n't carry around all the time . i think a slim camera is a better choice . i slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it . you ca n't do it with a huge camera . after i made up mind about a slim camera , my choices were either casio exilim or sony dscw series . casio exilims are very sexy . they have a lot of mode scenes . they also function as voice recorder . you can take pictures of book pages etc. they have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images . i was almost buying a casio exilim . being a diligent person i wanted to search more and more . i found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus . many people found it useless . that was a good reason to choose casio . then i found the picture quality of exilim is not really good.i found some pictures taken with exilim . they were soft , not crisp colors . search the web reviews made by photo professionals . casio exilim is rated significantly less than sony in picture quality . with iso 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . those same reviewers however found sony dscw doing a better job . there was no noise with iso 400 which means even in lower light condition sony did a better job ( less granularity in pictures with low light ) . big difference ! . one feature of sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro . it is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch ( 2 mm ) close to an object ( say a bug ) and still take a brilliant picture of it . now comparison of exilim and sony to summarize : casio exilim anti-shake ( it 's a bogus ) slim lower macro ( 2.5 inches ) lower picture quality ( detectable noise at iso 200 ) a lot of scene modes quick shutter sony dscw series slim ( in fact it is slimmer ) higher macro ( 0.74 inches ) higher picture quality ( no noise in iso 400 ) not a lot of scene modes quick shutter so.....i purchased a sony dscw 7 mp. i took lots of pictures . they are all brilliant , detailed and crisp , true colors . i tried macro and took pictures of bugs . you can see the hairs on the legs of bugs . absolutely no noise whatsoever , no blurry . it 's a marvel of technology . i took pictures of fireworks in july 4th using high iso setting . they came out brialliantly like professional pictures . it also uses a different kind of battery that you ca n't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable . so you may wanna buy a spare one ( about 40 bucks ) . but you can always recharge it . and it lasts much much longer than aaa or nimh batteries . it was a perfect choice . i highly recommend it .

this is the author 's presentation of the satipatthana sutra , the basic sutra on mindfullness . as in all of his works he does the work of a good dharma teacher very well . he keeps his own personality and teaching idiosyncrasies out of the way so that the student 's understanding can arise naturally . there are more elaborate and academic descriptions of the sutra available and more detailed descriptions of how to use the sutra in meditation . but this is good basic information presented in a good manner with no frills or personal quirks . the author gives a good commentary on the sutra and explains why he translates certain passages , but he also gives the alternate interpretations . this is a fine basic introduction to the central issue in vapassana meditation . highly recommended

as crow puts it , if it had not snowed on that monday in march . the snow led to a chain of circumstances with crow bringing a homeless teenager home for dinner and a place to stay for the night . it turns out that the teenager , lloyd , was a witness to a crime , and that draws tess into the case when she connects lloyd to a news reporter . events disrupt her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she reveal the name of the source . the story starts with a narration by crow , and alternates between crow , tess , and other characters in the story . you will get a lot more crow in this novel than in others . the story has an interesting ending , and you can wonder if lloyd will show up again . you get some information along the way about baltimore soup kitchens and the homeless , and a view of the underside of society where life is sometimes cheap

while not dissimilar to other excellent acts such as coldplay , keane , and pete yorn , travis have distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style and sound . this , their 2nd album , is the best of their music : melodic throughout , with catchy tunes , solid lyrics , and tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first chords of ' sing ' to the fade-out from ' the humpty dumpty love song' . if you buy an album once you know three or four or more of its songs are excellent , then i confidently recommend the invisible band to you . rating each song individually for one 's ipod : 1. sing , side , the cage , afterglow and the humpty dumpty love song are each worthy of four to five stars 2. pipe dreams , flowers in the window , safe , follow the light , and indefinitely are three to four star songs 3. the balance are two to three stars each . the only poor effort is probably " last train " , which is too plodding relative to its counterparts the invisible band is basically a healthy mix of folksy , hopeful songs mixed with just the right amount of melancholy . nowhere is this better reflected than in ' the humpty dumpty love song ' , which defines this mix perfectly . while this is the best of the album , the rest is well worth listening to repeatedly . highly recommended

i think this is the best book that i have ever read . i thought that the civil war was very , very boring but when our class started to read bull run i knew that i was wrong . the way that paul fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more . from the way paul fleischman described the characters to the words that paul flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye . each character has a different story of the war and of life . i would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the civil war . it supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn . this book was excellent from the first page i read . even though this novel is very brilliant , some people might not like it . if they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character , like one of my favorite characters dietrick herz . he had the funniest voice i ever heard . when paul fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging . but the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself . and trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book . the best that i have ever read and if i liked it then for surely you will love it too , trust me . before i read bull run i had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really , really new to me . i had to get use to it a little but since it was n't very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the bull run story by paul fleischman . some of the characters that i really liked was toby boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife . another was carlotta king because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what i mean by that is they can practice there own religion . another one of my favorite characters is vergil peavy . i think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story . in the story he sounds like he 's from texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes . and my last favorite character is shem suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with . shem suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses , that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses . but the reason i really really like him is because he minds his own business and does n't talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces . that is the reason why i like shem suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart

fraser 's film is truly a winner in production quality . his attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil . despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film ; eye-candy performers , lighting , fantastic musical score , and riske scenes , this film has visually appealing sequences . if anyone is interested in film and theatrical production , i would highly recommend the director 's commentary-you really get an insight to an artist in process . from the commentary , it seems that fraser will never be finished with this film : a mentale that i admire in an artist . art is a process and is never perfect . this is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film . getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future . this film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people . i did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however . though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide , i feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs . i had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as " selfish gay guy ruins a marriage " . ( on the other hand , cherilee taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script ; she was n't quite the victim her character ultimately could have become . ) by the end of the film , i was wondering how violet was making it as a once again as single woman . from an audience 's standpoint , we did n't really see that . david and kryla make up , matt goes to illustration school , but what happens to violet ? overall , i would highly recommend this film . with such a great interpretation on the screen , it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres .

i use three razors . last year 's model of this braun , a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors . ok , now , let 's do some math . i get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor . i pay , on average , 40c or so for a disposable razor . that is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream . at a nickel a shave , it would take 3000 shaves before i would spend $150. would take me over 8 years . now , anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor ( not even the expensive triple edged ones , just cheap disposables ) is dreaming . the blace does a much better job and much faster . but , sometimes , they can irritate the skin , but electrics can too . i can get irritated by both , sooooo , i rotate between them , and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well . i bought this braun ( last year 's model ) after reading the positive reviews here , and later bought a rotary razor . the basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter , shaves just as well , and cost me about 1 / 3 the price . the only thing that is better in the braun is the battery lasts longer . it is possible also , that in some cases , it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary , but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times i go over them . the braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer , like when i have two to three days growth . the rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush . the cleaning machine / charger that comes with the braun is a joke . yes , it cleans the razor great , but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom . even then , say you have that larger space , you can pay between $5.00 and $8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges . i have found they last about a month before drying out . add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor . the rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water . finally , the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade . so i am constantly locking the blade position by accident . inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price . do n't get me wrong . this razor shaves fine . it works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors . but for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade . does the price difference sound rational to you ? if it does , click " proceed to order "

presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a prince album or two but do n't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection . the way this is laid out though is confusing at best : disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable . ( " my name is prince " ? his take on " nothing compares 2 u " when sinead o'connor 's is definitive ? ) disc 2 compiles 12 " mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e . for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat his purpleness every records . bottom line : this is haphazardly thrown together . middle range fans are better off with the hits / the b-sides which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material ( some of which equals his singles )

i could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety . i think i made it about 45 minutes in . despite many fine actors , esp . the always interesting jeff bridges , who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles , i simply could not connect and did not care about these people . it was this huge budget american movie shorthand : we 're supposed to care because we 've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else , but it just does n't work for me . if i do n't care this far into the movie , it just wo n't happen . visually beautiful , and sky high production values on costumes and sets , it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling . whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces , which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of , but why do n't we get faces like that in the major characters . of course chris cooper has that kind of face , but many others ( esp . all the " size 2 women " in the supporting roles ) seem to have stepped out of a commercial . the chicago tribune called this film " sleek and beautiful . " i will completely agree with that , but so are music videos . i kept asking myself , what is wrong , what is misfiring ? i really wanted to like it . some of it is the short-hand story telling , but the look was almost too pretty . when the cinematography is this gorgeous , you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper , or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series . ultimately , i began wondering if the original length was much longer , and it was cut down so much that it became fractured , and if that is the case , my apologies to the director . this is the kind of film that makes me ponder , what is it that european film-makers " get " that we lose in our big budget studio films ? is the system itself hurting some films , by sanitizing and conforming them , when they need to stick out like an unruly horse 's nose at the starting gate ? very beautiful , but no connection , and not satisfying.. . well , that 's a lot of things in hollywood in a nutshell , is n't it ? there are lots of special features on this dvd , but if i ca n't sit through the film , i do n't care about the extras . so glad i borrowed this instead of buying it ! i hear the book is something wonderful.. .

a quality photography book that visually recounts pertinent steps in the history of noir photography and more specifically , the creation of the term noir as it pertains to film and photography in the 20th c . in new york city . a breath of realism , history and fact that beautifully illustrates a fine curatorial example of the kinds of images published by the daily news that made this paper a forerunner in the telling of real stories suffered and celebrated by real people . william hannigan is to be commended for his fine selection of photographic and negative samples of a time not long past and still very alive in the movies and crime documents that inspire and fascinate us today . a necessary addition to any photo library of value

i have purchased both the home & gardens interior and the punch interior software . home & gardens is much easier to use . you can really start without reading much of the manual . punch demands that you read the manual ( 342 pages ) . it is not intuative . but punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity . ie : punch has a library of trees , shrubs and flowers for your yard . home & gardens only have potted plants , nothing you can use to landscape . punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications . h&g doesn't . you have to choose a set style of door or window and change options.i also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my " house " on punch to make it more realisitic . i like both software programs , but punch has more options , but you have to do your homework first

somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and i am sure if ben and matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime . however - it just may be one of those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible to re-capture , and in a sense , haunting . i am not obsessive in any way but i have watched this movie at least twenty times - with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where i sometimes go for comfort . the synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a great story most definitely puts this movie in a special category - so buy it and watch it . you 'll be glad you did . mik

therese , lux , mary , bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17. cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors . as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident . after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr. and mrs. lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr. and mrs. lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party . some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh . midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs. lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it . cecilia goes up to her room ( on the second floor of a two-story house ) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house . in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide . only four girls remain . the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed . the father saw her immediately , the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum . four of the lisbon 's neighbors , four young boys , suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls , who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world . they got hold of cecilia 's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide . the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer , and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window , she thought she would fly . with their youngest sister gone , the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other , stranding themselves further from the outside world . when school starts again , they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened , not ever mentioning their youngest sister . the run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however . the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word " death " and the like . trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school , the object of desire to all of the girls at school.. . except for the lisbon girls , which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux . trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty . in the beginning , he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she 's not interested . but after his consistent courtship , lux falls for his charming ways . trip then attempts to convince mr. lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming . after mr. lisbon talks to his wife , he agrees to trip 's request , knowing nothing but trip 's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions , on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew . after trip explains the situation to his football peers , he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely . meanwhile , the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance . though one pattern is used for all four dresses , each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail . once they pick up the girls , they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke , lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke . they then drive to the dance . trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol . another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow , but leave soon afterwards , not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux . at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew , they are all there.. . except for trip and lux , who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field . deciding they must make their own curfews , therese , bonnie , mary and their dates leave without them . after fooling around , the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium . trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone . when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there . she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick ( of course ) . but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence . the girls , in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world , begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives . one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls . soon following , the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone . one day , the girls invite the boys to come over once mr. and mrs. lisbon are asleep . the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere , the boys hastily agree . they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car . the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese , bonnie and mary , verbally expressing their hopes for the night . but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters . she had hung herself . the boys , scared to death , run all the way home . time passed , things changed , girls came and went.. . but no matter what , those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides . ultimately , the movie was nothing short of queer . when trying to sum up the story in a few lines ( such as " follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors . a story full of obsession , gossip , lust , love , desire and isolation . " ) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing , but the story fell short of that for me personally . partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation . the movie , in places , is also extremely flawed . i do not believe mr. and mrs. lisbon could 've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services . in many parts of the movie , they should 've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences . the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film to , perhaps , people who like movies such as " elizabethtown " which kirsten dunst is also in . but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future

the lawsuit mentioned in mr john matlock " gunny " review has nothing to do with the quality or legality of documents created using quicken willmaker plus software . instead , it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license . he used will-making software ( not quicken willmaker plus ) to write a will for an elderly client . the trouble arose because he created the will outside of her presence and arranged for her to sign it while she was hospitalized . apparently she never reviewed the will . in other words , he acted too much like a lawyer . while the " unauthorized practice of law " is a vague concept , had the insurance agent merely recorded the woman 's wishes and entered them verbatim into the software , there would almost certainly have been no problem . there is no problem with using software to prepare a will for your self . nor is there a problem with using it to create a will for someone else if you merely type in that person 's answers at their direction . the main way to run afoul of unauthorized-practice-of-law rules is to give legal advice to or prepare documents for others without their express , detailed instructions .

i am a huge u2 fan and this is the best concert i have ever seen . this concert is simply unbeliveable . it proves to all those stupid people that the belief that u2 were only good in the 80s and 90s is a load of garbage . u2 's still got it . this concert proves it . if you do n't think u2 's good anymore , go watch this concert . all that you ca n't leave behind is a good album . maybe not as good as joshua tree and achtung baby but it is still good . how to dismantle an atomic bomb left a little to be desired . and for the stupid guy at the beginning of these reviews ( i think it was the first one ) what do you mean bono was supporting homosexuality ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? when he kissed edge , it was representing the betrayal of jesus christ . look up the lyrics to the song that they were singing , " until the end of the world . " " i took the money.. . i kissed your lips ( face in the concert ) and broke your heart . " bono represents judas iscariot in the song . also , if you still do n't believe me and think this is some love song or something , watch any u2 concert with this song - almost all of them show bono doing a little devil-horn thing , usually after kissing edge ( christ ) the only thing i agree with in that guy 's review is that edge really is the spirit of the band , not bono . i love the delay that edge uses in his guitar . and i hate how when people think of u2 they think of bono . bono 's fine but i love how edge plays . anyway , go read his review if you want to find out more . just do n't listen to that homosexuality crap . anyway , this concert is awesome and i could just watch it over and over again . in fact , i 'm actually watching it tonight ! great show - makes you feel like you 're actually there . u2 is a wonderful band with good christian messages in their songs and i ca n't wait for their next album and concert to come out

i think india is one of the most talented artists today . her voice is sensational . sadly , as with many great artists today , this album feels more producer / market-driven rather than artist-driven . i understand that regaetton is popular right now . i would even understand including a few reggaeton-flavored songs to " keep up with the times " ( shakira 's " la tortura " comes to mind ) . but who mixes two genres within a single song ? ! ? " soy differente " flows perfectly as a salsa , until regaetton beats come in . the style feels very out-of-place in this song , as in most other songs in this album . maybe this kind of thing will work at a club , but not for extended listening . in my opinion , the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling india 's own style . i hope she will regain contol by the next album

first of all , let me say this product is great in almost every way . so if you need to feel better about your nose and / or throat , go for it . my main complain about the grossan hydro pulse is that it is noticeably expensive . some time ago , grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to a waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the hydro pulse . but then , grossan decided to produce his own machine and , if i 'm right , viajet is making it for him . viajet sells the same machine , except for the grossan tip , at about -again - a half the price of the hydro pulse . the breathe-ease solution that you might use along with the irrigator is also expensive ( i have check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be purchased in my country ) . so what makes the hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health is a business , after all . other than that , like i have said , this product is great for almost any respiratory problem . i used to irrigate my nose with a similar solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle , and is intended to use it over 50 times . the hydro pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean everytime , so you get the idea . also , if you are suffering respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free treatment , look for the buteyko method

( however , if that 's the only measure by which you 're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it 's quite a good camera . what i like about it most : - it looks and feels solid . some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars . it 's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over , but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it 's category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility with decade 's worth of nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week . - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800. - nikon 's raw software and control software are n't included with the camera , and are imho overpriced . ( ...and on top of that , nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages.. . ) what would improve this camera the most : - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets , and then pull them up on the fly . - replacing the " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc. ) with modes that you could customize

i had a chance to read this book cover to cover . all i can say is & quot ; absolutely outstanding&quot ; , short of calling it a historical masterpiece in the field . very rarely do i encounter an epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well . it is optimally reader friendly ; the author appears to have such a talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and statistical concepts in such a simplified language . yet he does not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological and statistical concepts . new concepts such as causal graphs and instrumental variables are also included and explained beautifully . i strongly recommend this book to all early to intermediate graduate students majoring in epidemiology . established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh and update their knowledge . i hope the author writes more textbooks with the same style

this is my all time favourite jacksons album . this album , along with ` mama ca n't buy you love ' and anything by donna summer were hogging the airwaves during my first visit to the states as a kid . comprising mainly jackson compositions ( and production ) , it showed a more mature and funky side of the group , and was far more consistent than their hit filled but patchy motown works . filled with their trademark smooth harmonies , lots of horns and michael 's distinctive vocals , the album hit #11 on the billboard album charts ( #3 r&b ) , was certified platinum and had a smash hit single in ` shake your body ( down to the ground ) ' #7 pop . ` blame it on the boogie ' opened the album in style , a funky upbeat disco tune that one could n't keep still while it played . other dancefloor anthems are the horn laden ` things i do for you ' , the frenetic ` all night dancin' ' , and the shimmery ` shake your body ' with its distinctive riff , which hinted at future mj songs like ` do n't stop till you get enough ' and ` workin ' day and night' . for me however , the songs that really did it for me were the ballads . ` push me away ' is a lush sun kissed ballad featuring a passionate vocal delivery from michael , alternating from full voice to falsetto with ease . great horns ! title track ` destiny ' has an acoustic guitar intro which leads into an amazing ballad where michael declares ` if it 's the rich life i do n't want it / happiness aint always material things' . great backing harmonies too . ` bless his soul ' is simply stunning ! featuring pensive lyrics about trying to do what 's right , but never seeming to please anyone . ` you just ca n't please the world and yourself ' sings jackie . this song starts off tender with congas , fleeting horns and strings which after the second chorus builds to a superb climax of ` the life you 're living is dangerous ' and a fab outro of ` hey , ha ha ha' . then comes the final track and my favourite . the dramatic ` that 's what you get for being polite' . a thumping piano leads to horns and sweeping strings , and then michael tells us the sad tale of some lonely guy named jack who wants to be what he is not and would do anything for love . dazzling instrumentation , a stellar vocal performance from michael , the cover art was a painting depicting the group with their huge afros , and the original vinyl release folded open like a book with individual shots of the brothers . one of my favourite childhood albums , one of my all time favourite albums , and a classic !

i 'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about ( sounds like someone with an axe to grind ) but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship . the music is inspired , the melodies transcending , and the emotion - deep and meaningful . as far as " copying yanni " goes , well - i do n't agree , in fact , yanni is far more generic and less inspired . the sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact not the same nor , are they yanni 's creation . i write this review to commend mr farish on his work , and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and could n't resist his own urge to see his " critique " in print . ryans music is distinctly his own , no question - and any similarities are tonal , and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of . as far as i 'm concerned , you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve 's and websites for music to criticize - and well , make themselves feel a little better . personally , i would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy . all the other stuff is for hacks ! enjoy this music ! i do .

' torzók ' ( ' abandoned ' ) is a brilliant hungarian film written and directed by Árpád sopsits that takes us back to hungary of 1960 when the oppressive communist rule altered the lives of everyone , especially children . the quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring . it may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended , but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure . Áron ( tamás mészáros ) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce : the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father ( sándor gáspár ) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters . Áron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive . he is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother 's blindness by his friend atilla ( szabolcs csizmadia ) and the two bond emotionally and physically . in this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper anya ( krisztina somogyi ) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff . there is one ' teacher ' in the orphanage school , nyitrai ( lászló gálffi ) who has been reduced to his position as an ' imprisoned one ' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy . nyitrai offers Áron solace and introduces his ' fellow traveler ' to the glory of the stars , giving Áron a map of the heavens that Áron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage . he gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when nyitrai , in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government , hangs himself . this horrid incident drives Áron to organize an escape from the orphanage , an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which Áron feels responsible . and the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger . the atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by péter szatmári defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in hungary of that period . the musical score by péter fejcsik , tamás görgényi , ferenc toma , and balázs winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen , making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings . in all , this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking , acted with depth in every role , and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books . highly recommended . grady harp , march 06

in the days of the arcades there was a good movie that came out ( and funny enough had a great arcade game ) called krull . now mind you , i really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it ( when i was a whole bunch younger ) just saw the 5 bladed " glaive " and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie ( including those terrible scifi d&d movies ugh ) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the slayers and from then on its a totally different experience . with such ultimate favorites as the emerald seer , the widow of the web and the cyclops and of course the shapeshifting ( a bit daft too ) wizard with some very strange habits ( i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it ) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come . pros : cool effects ( for the time ) good story well done plot and themes cons : may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough . but remember it is a tad old . its a 5 star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made this movie great

to say this film is self-indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement . almost every joke in this movie that did n't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of smiths other movies . maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that , but if you have only made 4 other films ( very poor ones too by cinematic standards ) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego . the film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid , although the humor really dose n't reach even that level . here is a recap of the types of humor in this film . making fun of fans , fart jokes , scatological jokes , profanity ( yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself ) , making fun of miramax , making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film ( i swear i am not making this up ) , and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew . this movie comes across as crass , tasteless , profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects . thank god i borrowed this movie and did n't pay anything to rent it . i wo n't be watching another kevin smith movie anytime soon

the ergonomics : perfect . the d200 is not completely rubber-encased . there 's rubber where your hands need to hold it , and plastic where your hands rarely touch it . the hand grip is comfortable and nicely concave where the tips of your fingers can dig in . the battery door and the memory card door are made of plastic , and hinge-pinned . a simple slide latch opens the battery door....and some have warned the latch could be easily ( accidentally ) tripped . the memory card door latch , however , uses a more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 and video out / dc-in doors are made of flexible rubber , and these doors extend into the body of the camera as the hinges themselves . the english language operating manual is a work of art . each operating concept is alpha ' & numerically numbered at the pictoral diagram , and to the page where the function is explained in perfect english . the reader will quickly catch on to how this well thought out manual is organized . i like the depth of field preview , the mirror lock-up , and the multiple-exposure capability . the continuous servo autofocus does a better job than any human at following and focusing on any moving object . if you have the old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses from the ' 70 's and ' 80 's , except for a few rare exceptions , will fit on the d200. all these positive attributes remind me of the best , most highly-evolved film camera slr's . no wonder so many photographers have been won over to digital media .

the first cd from baby anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare . i would n't claim that 's a bad thing , but do n't expect to be surprised if you 're familiar with the genre . overall it 's a solid offering from baby anne and delivers the bass . the second cd is a surprising mix from jen lasher , who has abandoned her old breakbeat sound and fully adopted a more electro feel . to those who have labeled this " industrial " i will say first and foremost that you are wrong . there is not one remotely industrial track on the cd . what she does provide is an extremely varied mix of synthpop , house , and a couple breaks tracks , all very vocal and sporting an electro pop flare , sometimes approaching the full-on ny electroclash sound . from someone quite familiar with electropop artists i ca n't recommend highly enough this diverse mix guaranteed to please newcomers and electro afficianados alike . my only complaint is the strikingly misplaced wolfsheim track , which i can only assume fueled the misguided and completely false depeche mode comparison from another reviewer .

as someone said in an earlier review , the movie is split up into two parts . the first part , training camp , was good . i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam . after that , i found it unwatchable . the main character is so annoying , i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast . if you 're looking for a good war movie , look elsewhere .

this book has its good points . if anything , it helps you put into words what you want from a supervisor , but it is not very accurate . the online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you , or if they do n't describe you at all . this messes up the results , and it did not describe me very well . i am not just in denial . i have taken a lot of personality type tests , like the keirsey temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths . so , although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths , it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology . as for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees , i'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate . the company i work for has done this , and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths ( according to this book ) are very unhappy in their new positions . your money can be spent better elsewhere . i say its only worth about $10

i was introduced to the matthew shepard story by mtv 's dramatic presentation of matthew 's last days in laramie . with that as my background , i entered the laramie project with curiosity regarding the reactions of laramie 's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention . matthew was a human being , undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death . shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several laramie residents , but not everyone shared that view . that fact was refreshing . the law enforcement officer who freed matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic . her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed , but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent . other laramie residents were just as horrified . the so-called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected , but equally unnerving . this film , though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed , has the feel of a documentary . knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times . but the presentation was enlightening . the film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that - crimes . no matter what a person 's viewpoint , lifestyle or background , no one has a right to take on the position of punisher . humans are not animals . or , at least they should n't act like them . the laramie project exposes the heart of many people after the matthew shepard murder . it is worth the watch

i 'm a horn performance major , and i bought this box set because i needed recordings of all of beethoven 's symphonies but at a low cost . now first off , yes , they sound great . however , i 've noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony : karajan changes beethoven 's orchestration ! allow me to explain : the horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns - - instruments bound to the overtone series . on the " natural " or " hand " horn , pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment ( like a bugle ) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell . this technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches , however , the " stopped " notes have an entirely different tone color ; most composers favored " open " pitches , especially for symphonic works . in the exposition , the second theme is announced by a call in e-flat by the horns . however , in the recap , the same call must be in the tonic ( c ) , as dictated by sonata form . the horn part is written for e-flat horns , which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised e-flat major , the relative major . the e-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment - - they are all " open " notes . however , in the recapitulation , the c call would include two " closed " notes if it were played by the e-flat horn . the horns could change crooks and become c horns , in which case the call would again be all open partials , but beethoven does not do this ; i am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in e-flat for the transition , leaving them no time to change , or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement . for whatever reason , beethoven left the horns in e-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again , which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound , beethoven moved the call to the bassoons . in karajan 's recording , the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation . granted , if beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns , he might have written both calls in the horn section . there is no way to prove for certain that this is the case , however . it strikes me as very arrogant to " correct " beethoven 's instrumentation , and i feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master 's writing is a more prudent performance choice .

my boyfriend bought from the earth to the moon , and since he is an astrophysics student i expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people 's conceptions about going to the moon at that early time . he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things did n't make much sense . well , from a layman 's perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging . it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic , physics and astronomy . even from my scientifically deprived perspective , a lot of things in the book did n't make much sense , such as the actual method of getting to the moon , but this does n't really take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal . the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous . i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work , and what these poor souls were going to come up with next . compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however , from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative . verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality , and much unlike his other works , does n't stray far from the earthly . some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion , but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read . if you drop at the sight of f ( x ) = y , then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking , centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate . if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today . if you , like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then from the earth to the moon is definitely worth your time .

old spice is a great-smelling cologne and i 've worn it for years . my dad wore it when i was growing up and i remember he almost always smelled of it . it 's a great cologne for lean , athletic guys who love retro ; it 's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men . it takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff . the smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention , otherwise he 'll just be annoying . old spice cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time ; exposing it to heat helps to age it ( leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building ) . trust me , it smells awesome if you let it age . i meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle . i 'm proud to say i 'm carrying on the tradition of wearing old spice cologne . it 's not nerdy and it 's not just for older men . it 's a cologne for any masculine guy . it smells great

bob quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era . but his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we 'd least like to go - - inside ourselves . i found this an incredibly powerful book . i 've used sections of it with my " change management " classes for several years and i know it has a tremendous impact on students , who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy . if you want a simple formula for change , do n't buy this book . although it is full of practical , actionable ideas , " change the world " addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for . it 's a very difficult but rewarding assignment

when paul mccartney goes on tour to connect with his beloved audience , it usually for more than just the average " oh , i have an album to promote , let me go on tour " . his 1989 tour was paul 's first time onstage in many years , and he used it to show he not only still had the energy and vigor he posssessed during his beatles & wings years , but he also still was able to create a deep , personal bond with his audience like few if any other artists can . this spawned the excellent double live album " tripping the live fantastic " as well as the exciting concert movie " get back " . his 2002 american tour was a chance for paul to use the healing power of music to ease the seething sadness caused by the horrific attacks on september 11th . the cd and dvd " back in the u.s. " were released to commemorate this wonderful act of musical philanthropy . in 2005 , paul did something that had long been awaited since the beatles first hit . ever since the cold war , the beatles were a huge phenemenon in russia . however , there communist government considered their music alien propoganda , and their music was outlawed . still , the russian citizens got their hands on the beatles ' recordings any way they could , and they felt a great deal of inspiration from them , making them belive there was a free world beyond the iron curtain . over 40 years later , paul ventured to moscow to perform a historic concert in red square to hundreds of thousands of devoted fans who had been waiting all their lives for this moment . the concert was filmed and was aired on a & e as " paul mccartney - live in red square " . this is quite simply an excellent concert movie . paul and his band are in top form . paul clearly wanted to give the russian fans a night they 'd never forget , pouring his heart and soul as well as his boundless energy into old warhorses such as " band on the run " , " live and let die " , " back in the u.s.s.r. " , " hey jude " and " let it be " , as well as performing rarely heard numbers such as " two of us " , " i 've just seen a face " and " let ' em in " . mixed in with the live performances are commentaries by scholars and fans on how the beatles ' music had such a connection with the russians during the cold war , and why they still remained so popular . these interviews manage to come off as insightful and entertaining rather than annoying and unneccessary , even when they occasionally cut off certain numbers . as an added bonus , we get another concert of paul in st. petersburg . this is once again an excellent , energetic and fun show that shows why paul to this day remains quite possibly the most beloved man in the music world . the sound and picture quality are excellent , and the special features are a nice treat . " live in red square " is an excellent dvd that belongs in everyone 's collection

this camera is simply amazing ! i started out with a canon g2 , and then a canon g6 , and then a canon 20d , and now this canon 1d mark ii n . i debated and researched for 3 months between the 1ds mark ii , 5d , and 30d . my decision was primarily narrowed down to the 5d and this 1d mark ii n . yes , i wish this camera was a full-frame and also shared the 12.8 mp like the 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying to weigh the pros and cons and finally i made my decision to go with this one and i 'm 110% glad that i did . for me , this camera is definitely the one to get because the 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , and the 1d pro body / interface / menu / layout , etc is what really makes this camera worth it and the deciding factor . trust me , if you do n't know how seriously fast the 8.5 fps really is , you need to go out to your camera store and try it out before you decide . because of this 8.5fps alone , i 'm actually able to capture a lot of shots that i normally get lucky getting with my 20d . and with a 5d at 3fps , i just said forget it...no way . i 'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living . this is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20d to this camera is out of this world . with the phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it 's like i 'm now playing with a bentley ( with the 1d mk2 n ) coming from a mercedes c230 hatchback ( the cheapest mercedes that people buy just because it 's a mercedes name and they do n't want to spend any more money on a real mercedes ) . this camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro . also , i do n't shoot action pictures all the time , and i do love portrait photography , and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures . but even with the 1.3 crop factor , there is still a huge improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you wo n't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you 'll have on a 5d . with this 1d mk2 n , you can still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc. as much as i 'd like to have 12.8mp like the 5d , 8mp is really all that we need these days unless you 're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8x10 's or around there . unless you 're printing extremely large posters and whatnot , you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5d can . the resolution and mp is definitely enough . plus , it 's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to . the extra bonuses with this camera which i look at as a secondary positive , are the weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy to use and navigate menu system , you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times , dual memory card capability , you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you do n't have to shell out extra for this ) , longer battery life than the other cameras , best customization and most options that you can set to your liking , more than the 5d or the 20d or 30d . i could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it . otherwise , the 5d is also a great choice too if you need to save the money , and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long , or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments , and do n't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that 's great for ai servo .

did you lose interest in new rock in the past several years because all those loud songs on the fm station sound about the same ? maybe you noticed one song in there somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among the crunching guitars ? the libertines are - or at least were - one of those diamonds in the rough . their raw , loud style is closer to punk than any other genre , but most of their songs are more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to classic rock fans . make no mistake , though , this is a loud album . with the exception of the oddly balladish " radio america , " it 's a pretty steady sonic assault , and the lyrics are mostly somewhere between " louie louie " and live dylan on the intelligibility scale . what can be understood is more erudite than you 'd expect , though . " what a waster " is a frighteningly vivid look at drug addiction , " boys in the band " is the best groupie song i 've heard in a long time , and " the good old days " actually reveals a touch of sentimentality just under the power chords . decipherable or not , most of the other songs are at least very catchy . the whole collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time now .

( 2 ) dim-light photography is very grainy , with lots of noise . night-time photography is impossible . these problems are not unique to our camera.. . you will find many corroborating reviews above . overall , i am very disappointed in this camera , and wish i could exchange it for something else . do not buy this camera . other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures ( and they are still small pocket-size cameras ) .

less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor , " in like flint " still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the bond films . the indomitable derek flint returns to save the world , this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world 's women while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered substitutes ( leading to , perhaps , the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film- -upon discovering that the man in the white house is not who he seems to be , a disbelieving flint says , " an actor as president ? " ) . that is , until a renegade zowie general ( steve inhat ) decides it 's his turn to take the reins of power . the delightful lee j . cobb is back as flint 's curmudgeonly boss , cramden , as are the secret agent 's posse of female admirers , and tv 's batgirl , yvonne craig , even shows up as a russian ballerina . " in like flint " feels more grown up than the previous film , partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody . notions like the red scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind- -and charging a premium for them- -are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows , cross-dressing , and the bouncing sing-a-long ball . only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either flint film worth comment , as it 's a staple of the genre , meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort : a no-frills dvd .

this is a complete joke . the only cities that are in the program for u.s. states are major metro areas . if you have a handheld ( either regular or mobile phone ) you more than likely also have wifi or gprs internet connection . and if you are in a major metro area , with a wifi connection , why would you need a program for maps ? just go to yahoo maps or mapquest . if you do n't have a wifi , then just buy a paper map...it will do the same thing ( maybe even more ! ) than this program . the only possible way this program could be useful is if you already have a handheld gps receiver and you never find yourself outside major metropolitan cities . i have a gps receiver for my laptop ( usb ) which i though could connect to my handheld and it won't ...so my advice is to buy an entire package ( software and handheld-specific gps receiver ) . ca n't believe microsoft put its name on this junk

it was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade word and excel , and to get virtual pc ( for access ) as well . i used them a lot on my pc a few years ago , and when i first switched to mac , could n't find software that did what they did . i had no trouble installing the upgrade on my imac g5 , nor did i have trouble installing virtual pc . the only thing that was disappointing was that i could n't find out whether accessing the internet from virtual pc would open me up to pc-type viruses , or if mac 's unix system would protect me there , too . i continue to be disappointed that the mac version of this software is not as rich as the pc version . but the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do

first published in 1936 , this is the 12th poirot book , the 3rd superintendent battle book , and the 2nd colonel race book , and has no narrator . it 's the first case in which superintendent battle , mrs. oliver , or col . race appear together with poirot or each other , and the only case in which *all* do so at once . the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes , where poirot encounters mr. shaitana , a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip . shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose , which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he 's a victim waiting to happen . for shaitana , like a few other collectors in christie 's universe , has succumbed to a foolish temptation , and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius , but murderers . and being a connoisseur , he collects only the best : those who have gotten away with it . he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby , without naming names , and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of " tigers " ( poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger , but would do so from outside the tiger 's cage , having respect for the danger . ) poirot accepts the supper invitation , however , to find that there are seven other guests , including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers : explorer major despard , a strong silent type ; mrs. lorrimer , a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge ; timid young anne meredith ; and dr. roberts , a loud and jovial general practitioner . shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder , but otherwise the subject does not come up , and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead , stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players ! this is , of course , poirot 's fantasy case , as he once remarked in the abc murders - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another . there are only the people themselves , and their memories of the evening , and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed . solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved . but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they 'd committed and gotten away with ? rather than following poirot 's viewpoint in third person throughout , some chapters follow battle , race , or mrs. oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case . each represents a different style : battle is a professional police officer , race an empire-builder-type secret agent , and mrs. oliver a writer of detective stories . battle , of course , has a duty to investigate shaitana 's murder , and does so in an orthodox style , cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him . race deals with checking out major despard , the explorer who 's most clearly his kind of person . mrs. oliver , for her part , works on worming information out of not only anne meredith , but her roommate rhonda ( whose attitude is that anne could 've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she 'd been paying attention ) . and , of course , there 's poirot . he 's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn , pursuing two major lines of questioning : ( 1 ) describe how the bridge games played out , and ( 2 ) describe the scene of the murder ( the elaborate collector 's room in shaitana 's house where the bridge games were played ) . see if you can figure out where poirot 's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues , and what he learned from the responses he received

those who condemn this book for not being a long , boring list of name origins and meanings , or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today 's children , are missing the point . " baby names now " is a fun , readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s , including famous namesakes ( saints , popes , presidents , royalty , music and movie stars ) and what some celebrities have named their children . it 's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style : for example " lisa , " " amy , " " susan " and " dawn " were very popular for babies born in the 60s ( and thus , my classmates ) , but are rarely used today . the book 's major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire , not just the first names . at one point , it reads " harrison ford...is almost certainly the reason for the name harrison 's popularity " - excuse me , ever hear of the beatles ? the entries for the name " jordan " do n't mention michael jordan , certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area . the entry for " jackson " does n't mention michael , janet , or samuel l . the entry for " landon " does n't mention michael . the entries for " cassidy " do n't mention david and shaun , so popular in the 70s when many of today 's moms were growing up . the entry for " lucas " - do i have to say it , fellow star wars kids grown up and naming their children ? and come on , how can you mention the name " wayne " without acknowledging the popularity of john wayne ? still , this is a lot of fun , and i give the authors credit for recognizing that " althea " is from a grateful dead song . i look forward to the next edition

the perpetrators of a high-level corporate scandal ( masayuki mori , takashi shimura , ko nishimura ) are pursued by the illegitamate son ( toshiro mifune ) of a low-level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes . this film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic , but the masterful director akira kurosawa is not content to let it rest there . he draws out all the moral complexities of the situation , then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title . the bad may not always go to prison for their crimes , but do they really " sleep well ?

" this cd secretly installs drm ( digital rights management ) software on your pc without your permission . not only does it do this , but the software then hides itself by installing as a " root kit . " as per wikipedia , - - root kit from wikipedia , the free encyclopedia . a root kit is a set of tools used by an intruder after cracking a computer system . these tools can help the attacker maintain his or her access to the system and use it for malicious purposes . root kits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as linux , solaris and versions of microsoft windows . a rootkit typically hides logins , processes , files , and logs and may include software to intercept data from terminals , network connections , and the keyboard . in many sources , rootkits are counted as trojan horses . - - in this instance , sony installs drm software to copy protect their cd , and prevent it from being copied to various devices , all the while not telling you , the user , or letting you uninstall it because it hides itself from the user and windows . manually trying to uninstall it like some people have done , results in their cd-rom drives disappearing entirely from windows , as sony installs their own custom cd-rom drivers onto the system . do not support this wreckless kind of copy protection . show the music business this is *your* music . *you* purchased it , and they should *not* be able to dictate how you can use it . do not buy this cd .

i 'll get to the plot of " the gang 's all here " in a minute , because the plot is n't the most memorable part of this movie . the most memorable part is the bananas . about 20 minutes into the movie , a towering hat of technicolor fruitappears on the screen , followed by its owner- - " brazilian bombshell " carmen miranda . she proceeds to do a number called " the lady in the tutti-frutti hat , " accompanied by chorus girls who bear bananas . six-foot-tall bananas that continuously droop and sprout until number 's end , when the chorus girls , worn out by the burden of this mutated fruit , lay down for a long siesta on a stage dressed up like an island . there 's a reason this number occurs so early on : it takes you the rest of the movie to convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie . but then , this is busby berkeley , a director who staged his musical numbers as though he was declaring war . and next to kitsch , war is pretty much the motivator here . the wafer-thin story involves andy ( james ellison ) , a soldier who woos and wins edie ( alice faye ) , a canteen dancer , the nightbefore andy goes off to world war two . in what seems an instant , andy gets decorated and returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of andy 's childhood sweetheart and fiancee- -who , unfortunately for edie , is not edie . will the heartbreak be resolved ? do you really care ? the plot is mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between major ' 40s stars ( in particular , eugene pallette and edward everett horton are hilarious ) , and the kind of musical numbers that seem to drop out of thin air . ( in a couple of scenes , benny goodman and his orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for the heck of it . ) " the gang 's all here " is really a 1943 time capsule , but an eye-popping rouser of one . they do n't make ' em like this anymore . they did n't make ' em much like this back then , either

" the dreaming was one of those albums that i found in my parents cd collection when i was young and i have n't outgrown it yet . my parents seemed to hate it and never bought a kate bush cd after it ( though i recently bought her whole collection except " the whole story " as it 's just a greatest hits ! ) . this album took me a very long time to get into however . i listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because i thought it was too strange . i took it out then several years later and loved it . i would now say it could be my all time favourite cd and is better than " hounds of love " as i see it . the songs all stand on their own and bush 's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through . this is the only album that i will never skip a track because i 'm always in the mood for them all . 1. " sat in your lap " - a great opening track . bush deals with whether she can be bothered to do something or not . the instruments are great as always . 2. " there goes a tenner " - a notable song for the quirky british accent bush puts on . the instruments are very good and remind me of the ' 80 's ( as it was made then ! ) . that was a good decade for music ! 3. " pull out the pin " - the piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good . the lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade . the song was inspired by a documentary . 4. " suspended in gaffa " - i do n't actually know what gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy . the lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent . 5. " leave it open " - an excellent song that reminds me more of " hounds of love " . the instrumentation is excellent as always . 6. " the dreaming " - another brilliant song which is so funny because of bush 's australian accent . the production is good and so is the songwriting . 7. " night of the swallow " - the use of irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song . the singing by bush is superb and the song is flawless ! 8. " all the love " - the song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent . the lyrics are unusual and very well done . the instruments complement bush 's superb voice and never overtake ! 9. " houdini " - the album cover is to do with this song . the song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation . 10. " get out of my house " - a perfect way to end an amazing album . the lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule ( within the song obviously ) . it is something only kate bush could have written ! overall i think it is an amazing album though i can see why people do n't like it . it could be a little too experimental for some though for me it is perfect . kate bush shows she was the original alternative female and the best ( yes , she 's better than tori amos ) . she is one of the few geniuses of music and an all time amazing artist . reccomended to everyone into alternative , especially tori amos fans ! mark - 10 / 1

solidly built , this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier sony cybershots like the dsc-r1. the remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake , which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified ( high optical zoom , supressed flash , etc ) . what surprises me is the fact that the shuttle release button on the remote works exactly the same as any sony cybershot : press halfway to focus , and all the way down to capture the shot . the zooming buttons do not work for the sony dsc-r1 as the camera has a manual zooming ring , but they should work fine with any other cybershot that comes with an electronic zoom and of course , an acc terminal . highly recommended .

if you 're reading this . you want to upgrade , your old computer to windows xp professional edition here are a few things to keep in mind . first thing is , you can download service pack two from windows update . so no need to buy it integrated with xp . these are what i consider the minimum system requirements : 256 mb of ram . i have found is adequate more equals better . 500 mhz or higher will do . 7200 rpm hard drive will help a lot . if you 're running windows millennium edition , or 98 upgrade now the stability is vastly improved . gone are the blue screens of death . frequently asked question : is windows xp pro better than home edition ? windows xp pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing . so for most users windows home edition is fine . they both are based on the same code and are almost identical . if you 're thinking of upgrading from windows 2000 , i did , because i like the gui interface better . but windows xp is as stable as windows 2000. so it 's your call . the plug-and-play ability of windows xp is totally great ! windows xp will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards , network cards , etc. that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for cds with drivers . i recommend upgrading to windows xp be a professional or home edition . it is a great operating system have some fun and get it done

i would argue that since we really have n't evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out . and despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace . in mary harron 's " american psycho " it comes out in all the wrong places . the film is a character study of one patrick bateman ( christian bale ) , a wall street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night . patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him . it 's not just the suits and the empty conversations either . it is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card . he tries to talk about his problems , he really does , but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period . to their ears " murders and executions " is interchangeable with " mergers and acquisitions . " the film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980's . this particular gordon gekko is overdone and overacted by christian bale in a great performance . he is robotic , phony , arrogant and absurd . he is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so ( all the while flexing his biceps ) . more than anything he is militantly materialistic . he is dexter mixed with jim profit , only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head . the whole point , which is made clear in the final scene , is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts . just because these people make enough cash to swim in , scrooge mcduck style , does n't mean that their behavior is excusable . harron paints the modern businessman as an american psycho , and it is all too fitting . to make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off , you must be turned into patrick bateman . the film is a great success . as a horror movie villain patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever . every scene has great energy to it and even though bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you ca n't stop watching him . there is something of a conflict presented when willem dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of patrick 's murders . that storyline is interesting while it lasts , but it is never quite wrapped up . i would also admit that after awhile i got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters . he may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but i eventually did . the character is endlessly fascinating ( what is up with his love of cheesy 80 's music ? ) and the scene where he kills paul allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized . the male need for aggression is n't going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it . . .otherwise we are going to have a lot more patrick bateman 's and iraq wars on our hands . ***3 /

i read about lila downs ' new cd , la cantina , in victor cruz - lugo 's article entitled , " sweet sorrow , " published in the june-july 2006 issue of hispanic magazine ( page 76 ) . it is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on lila downs ' new cd , la cantina : 1. the cd cover is awesome , a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating lila in a pensive and contemplative mid-air pause with her guitarra ready to rock . it strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time , awakening the historically-oppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song . 2. each track is a lively composition of mexican corridos and sones impregnated with lila 's lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicano-chicano-hualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family . 3. i first was introduced to lila downs and her musical talent when i enrolled in writer juan felipe herrera 's legendary manikrudo summer arts class at cal state fresno in 2000. juan felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her down-to-earth talented voice . later that night we all saw her in concert at the tower theatre in fresno and i 've been a fan of her work ever since . 4. this new cd is indeed a delightful experience . i appreciate that she moved into the corrido , son , etc. genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more . it has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious . it 's authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity . i think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of lila 's work . she is a true artist . i 've always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two cds , however , this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience . 5. i am very impressed with lila 's voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000. there seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon . ahua ! her solos in " yo ya me voy , " have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity . as victor cruz-lugo writes , " through it all , downs ' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart , tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same . " this is my favorite of lila 's repertoire . it is my opinion that those who purchase this cd will not be disappointed . enjoy !

first off anyone who gave this book five stars was employed by the publisher to up the rating that simple . i mean look at some of them they are so cheesy one of them actually refers to the author as mr. miller who is he brown nosing for sounds like a greeting card they are so " textbooky " and insincere . the book itself is almost entirely filler on how to read music ( which half the music books in borders are or they are just giant scale books that are reemed out like saw dust totally useless , which leads to the great difficulty on how to actually find an explantion to this jargon and then someone comes along and says they have an answer that will make things clear but then they fall short ) up until half the the book and many times periodically things are just repeated terminology loosely defined such as hook which is just recording industry jargon not theory . book never goes into the physical principals that would actually explain some things in it as to why the notes themselves are in the order they are such as acoustics , never got an answer as to what a whole step or a half step was by the way and when i asked many teachers and questioned them they knew nothing or gave a circular answer defining it themselves without an outside reference only to find that they were just parroting it all along . the problems with this is everything is assumed in the entire field . i recommend the only book that i have found that made some sense to me called fractals in music by charles madden much more organized and assembles things from the very beginning working into more and more complex shapes and structures .

coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences , blues has always been a multi-faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories:soulful blues , drinking blues and guitar blues . " b.b king - live at the regal " is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three . this recording is dear to my heart as i can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother ( god bless ) used to play this on 8-track . she used to love herself some riley " blues brother " king . this recording always seemed to be in the player when my cousins and i would come over to visit and rest assured , you will hear it before you left to go home . at that time , being the young naive kid that i was , i remember saying that i hated it and that it was old folks music . all grown up now , in an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on cds , i have a newfound respect for real stuff like this . so instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating , you have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music....the blues . in my opinion , " bb king live at the regal " is one of mr. king 's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums , this is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like . maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved . the arrangements were put together nicely & the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence . bb 's pickin ' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or bb king enthusiast . it sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time . the ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and bb was playing at his best . the only gripe i have about this disc is that it is very short ; which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in blues ( especially blues guitar ) . i recommend getting this and bb 's " live in cook county jail " . they both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard . good choice if you get this one .

i was intrigued by his & quot ; the end of history . &quot ; i thought his & quot ; trust&quot ; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation . i only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of good books . in the end , & quot ; the great disruption&quot ; is a down right silly book . it has a lot of usefull data but fukuyama 's humanistic ideology clouds it all . all his empirical data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion : that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good . fukuyama proves that the moral consensus - - the social capital - - of the earlier era has been wiped away . that crime has sky-rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men . then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital . he does n't bother to deal with societies - - like ethiopia - - that have never been able to build up enough social capital . he does n't really look any further back in history past about 1950. his generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history . he thinks ( based on his ideology of human goodness ) that things just have to get better . if he had studied pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history , he would know better . people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long-term historical cycles . for that , i would recommend robert w . fogel 's & quot ; the fourth great awakening and the future of egalitarianism . &quot ; fogel , a nobel prize winner , has all the optimism of fukuyama but with the history to back it up

i wanted to use this product to tape sporting events , as part of a promotions unit i belong to . i had used videowave 7 which was ok and produced a more than adequate product , but would on occassion crash to the extent i would have to reload the software . i thought i would give pe 3.0 ago , since adobe products generally have a good reputation . well , it goes to show that you ca n't just rely on reputation . the program lets me down horribly when capturing the video from the camera . the camera records dvd video ( vob files ) straight to dvd . when i capture these files into the pe program , all moving images within the video become pixelated with lost resolution to the point of being useless . i have tried various other ways of capturing but always the same result . there is nothing to be done from that point...for me this program falls on the first hurdle ! ! it is unbelievable to me that a professionally released image processing algorithm could corrupt video so badly , and frustrating that i actually paid money for it...a first year undergraduate could have provided a better effort . i have subsequently gone through the motions to produce a video , and to be honest he layout of the settings , ease of applicaiton of various functions is quite good and better than videowave 7 imho . i was able to produce quite nice edited products with intro , text and audio overlays very quickly . still this is n't much use when the video itself had already been digitally butchered . if you are videoing things that do n't move you may well like this product . if you are videoing dynamic scenes , give it a miss . big disappointment

this out of all the many versions of jane eyre has to be my least favorite.. . granted samantha morton has a very adorable fairy / elfin like face like mr rochesters description of her , but her acting has no highs and lows . she stands up to mr edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers , seemingly no respect to her employer , which is not fault of hers , the writing of the script is bad... . and so the direction . ciaran hinds is totally over the top . he is so angry with no understanding , his eyes are very lustful and at times crazed . he is not at all like the character described in brontes epic book of a very sad and tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the innocence and singular personality of earnest , honest and yet strong sweet jane eyre that charlotte bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words . the over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical.to me there is no love , feeling or chemistry here between the two actors just lust... . he seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl , and she though supposedy a virgin.. . she dos n't act like one . plus this movie seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story especially during janes childhood . i do also miss the gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the dalton / clarke mini series , which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story . if you want to see great versions . i highly rate the 1944 movie with orson wells though it is another abreviatd version , that movie truly captured the spirit and feel . it is moody dark and mysterious . another is the fantastic timothy dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the brontes story . dalton 's and clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime ! however if you are like me , see them all and make your own decision . they all have something to offer and most are entertaining.. .

first , the story takes place in the 1940s ( harold 's brother is mia in wwii , not in vietnam , as the amazon.com review erroneously states ) . second , the writing is superb . mr. lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel . his characters are very real . his setting ( a small , struggling circus , traveling the western u.s. ) is historically believable , peopled with ' freaks ' who suffer as sideshows , unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with , but peopled also with ' normals ' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks . harold , the 14-year-old albino central character , tries to straddle both groups of people . he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer . i am admittedly ignorant about such things , but mr. lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants- -crucial to the plot of the novel- -seem believable . my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end . i do want you to read this book , so i will try not to give anything away here , but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character 's last words and even gomer pyle-like ( people actuallly say " gosh ! " ) . this did detract from the impact of the death , unfortunately , but i still very strongly recommend this book . five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot !

$23 for the chinese version and the english subtitles are mad . the english subtitles available on american cable television enhance the drama so tape off of cable . i do n't regret this purchase because i think drama sets should be $25 tops and the camera is so clear on this dvd compared to what is seen on american cable that you can really see how old the teenagers are . it made for a more enjoyable viewing experience for me when i did n't really care for it when it was mistier and flawless on cable . so what if there are a lot of matching fat scarves and sweaters in this series ? i do n't get the appeal of this show at all . i thought it was really slow . my favorite part was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but otherwise i felt my hair turning white watching the characters walk and walk , breath in , breathe out , and ponder ponder . i think the phenomenon of the show 's popularity is a tidge more interesting than the show but it is still boring boring boring . just thinking about this show , strips another layer of elasticity from my heart . it 's so boring . p.s. this drama got a 20% rating domestically but sam soon and jang geum scored 50%. hahaha

made in 1959 , douglas sirk 's imitation of life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago . it 's a real cinematic treat , shameless tearjerker , and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one 's teenagers - in this case daughters- -are growing up and preparing to enter the world . lana turner has never looked more ravishing as lora meredith , a young new york widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of broadway stardom . together with her young daughter susie , they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence , their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams . one day at coney island , lora and susie meet another a white girl sarah jane , who is being taken care of by a black woman , annie johnson ( juanita moore ) , whom lora mistakes for the maid . when told by her that she 's the mother , the surprised lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child . the angelic and virtuous annie asks lora if she can come and help out around the apartment . lora is initially hesitant - not because of annie 's race but because she 's struggling and does n't have any money to pay her a wage . eventually , however , she relents and tells annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night . at the same time , lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer , steve archer ( john gavin ) . steve takes an instant liking to lora and offers to marry her . but lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage . meanwhile , the saintly annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white . imitation of life follows these characters throughout their lives , with sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get . lora does indeed become a famous broadway actress , yet neglects her growing daughter in the process . steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization , but has trouble relating to lora 's need to be independent and famous . annie 's heart is eventually broken , gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter . sara jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away . annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid ; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success . the contrast of the mother 's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story 's ultimate paradox . lora , annie , steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other . they all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it does n't seem to be doing them much good . they are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them . lora gets her career but she 's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother , whilst sara jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl , but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother . under douglas sirk 's accomplished direction , miss turner et al acts ornately and elaborately , everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life , especially lana 's gorgeous outfits , yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring . the screenplay is sophisticated , the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces , audacious colors , and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy , entrapment , and emotional anxiety , and where the price of following one 's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost . mike leonard june 06.

i bought this lens for my canon powershot g5 , and because it requires the use of a long adapter , not only does it cause terrible vignetting ( that circle the other poster thought was cool , but which is actually a design flaw ) unless you zoom most of the way , it blocks the built-in flash . i have owned four canon cameras over the past 15 years , and the g5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment . ( i would have bought the digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses , but it did n't allow flash exposure compensation ( insane for a $1000 camera body ) . ) i do not recommend this lens or any of the g-series digital cameras from canon . when i 've got the money i 'll be buying the latest digital rebel and upgrading some of my old eos lenses , and selling my entire powershot kit . if you are an experienced photographer , you will not like this system at all

in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts , the d70s has fallen behind the pack . ( however , if that 's the only measure by which you 're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it 's quite a good camera . what i like about it most : - it looks and feels solid . some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars . it 's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over , but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it 's category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility with decade 's worth of nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week . - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800. - nikon 's raw software and control software are n't included with the camera , and are imho overpriced . ( ...and on top of that , nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages.. . ) what would improve this camera the most : - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets , and then pull them up on the fly . - replacing the " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc. ) with modes that you could customize

the camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand . some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures . some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer . this camera 's randomly broke after about 1 year and i did not drop the camera ( just like another reviewer ) . i bought a sony pda and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the lcd . of course , sony said it was my fault and that i must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that pda - after 1 month ? since the camera was out of warranty , i knew there was nothing they were going to do . so if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it ! but if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products , look elsewhere . i used to be a great financial supporter of sony products - monitors , computers , camcorder , memory sticks , etc. i am not buying anymore sony products - i have lost the love for sony and their products ! beware ! canon , here i come !

before i review , i 'd like to clear something up : i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie . i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim , ghost in the shell : standalone complex . i absolutely love that show , and so i figured eventually i 'd have to get around to seeing the movie , which i knew full well shares no connection with the show . they 're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name , ( which i have not read , so i do n't know which is more accurate ) but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way . there are many things i do n't like about this movie , the biggest being poor pacing . the plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler , but that 's the biggest problem . there 's not really enough story to last a full-length feature , because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short . and since they did n't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes ( there are barely any , and they are n't very impressive for the most part ) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you wo n't understand more than 60% of , and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we 're looking at either nothing , or a woman 's nipples . that 's not cinematic artistry , that 's being either lazy or perverted . the animation itself is n't even that good , especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago . it 's choppy , and there 's not really a whole lot of detail ( except when it comes to women 's nipples ) . looking at just the animation , if i did n't know better , i 'd have thought this movie was an ova from the 1980's . the only thing i can really say i liked about this movie was that it was ghost in the shell . it 's probably kind of like how i did n't see the 1989 batman movie until years after i 'd been spoiled by batman the animated series , and could n't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was batman . everything about the tv series is superior to this movie : the animation , the stories , the character developement , the production values.. . i could go on for an entire page about how much better the tv series is . in short , if you 're you 're at all interested in the gits franchise , do yourself a favor and rent the dvds of the tv show instead . you 'll find a lot to love , but i ca n't say the same about the movie . my dream is that someday alex proyas will give us a gits movie that lives up to what i would hope for after watching standalone complex

let 's learn kanji is systematic , it gives you a wealth of basic kanji knowledge ( including stroke order and radicals ) as well as providing space to practice and regular worksheets / mini tests so you can monitor your progress ! often kanji books offer only examples and written explanations , or focus soley on repeated written practice . the addition of the mini tests for consolidating your learning makes this book a must have . i studied some kanji previously but found my self directed study slow . while i agree with the other reviewer that the pace seem stedious at first , i after a month i can claim some serious progress ! my only concern with this text is that from time to time the mini tests do not have an answer key . all in all an excellent book for self study by motivated beginners

long before the advent of the written word sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the vehicles of ritual , song and dance . i have come to believe that the ' old ways ' were in many cases the superior mode of transmission . mere words could never convey the multi-faceted beauty , wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and dance . this point is made crystal clear in this exquisite production of ' holo mai pele . ' ' holo mai pele ' is an exciting and exotic multi-media production that i found absoultely engrossing . the director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between the preparation of the event in the dance studio , the on-stage performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting hawaiian landscape . the on-stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic eruptions , lava flows and lush tropical rainforests . all of this is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano goddess pele and her battle with her youngest sister hi'iaka . the narrative is the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts the viewer from the performance . this dvd serves as both a wonderful introduction to the novice in hawaiiana and a much needed and revered document to the initiated providing a performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the hula and its embodiment of the hawaiian ' spirit of aloha . ' truly a sacred visual document to be treasured .

okay , first off , i 'd like to say that this is my first af slr- -i stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera , canon ae-1 manual focus , and right now i am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing . i 'm still in the learning stages of all this technology but let me tell you this , i am having fun ! it amazes me that canon can offer quite an impressive camera for the price . i just received my first few rolls from the developer and the pictures came out amazing- -so clear and the colors are very vibrant . just to let you know , i 'm using the 28-105mm f / 3.5-4.5 usm lens . i took the suggestions of many and passed up on the " kit " lens and i 'm sure glad i did so . i would highly recommend the f / 3.5-4.5 lens , but unfortunately for the rest of you , amazon has discontinued it . but you could order it from one of the many other photo shops ( b&h , adorama , etc ) . do i have any regrets on this purchase ? absolutely not ! i love this camera and even though i 've owned it for less than a month , i 'm actually thinking about stepping up to the eos 3 and using this as a backpacking / hiking body . hmm...what to do , what to do ? do i purchase another body or start a collection of l-series glass ? ...that is the question .

having had perfectly clear skin through my teens , 20s , and most of my 30s , i now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36. my skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most otc acne products . i bought this product out of desperation , not believing it would work . after reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks , i have found that it works well , with some modifications . my experience : cystic acne goes through its normal cycle ( rising to surface , becoming a hideous scab , etc. ) in a fraction of the normal time ( 4 days versus 4 weeks ) when treated as directed with zeno , or it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface ( after a week or so ) , when treated very aggressively with zeno . my advice : do n't expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised . do know that with diligence and patience , it will work . be very aggressive . do double-cycles ( allow the zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps , then press the button for a second cycle ) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way . you may get very slight burning of your skin ( causing a whitish film or slight peeling ) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly , but believe me , it 's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne . i am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition , and seeing the results i have hoped for after 2 weeks

to be or not to be is a comedy set during wwii . although it makes light of a tense time in history , it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease . the story revolves around two actors in poland , maria and joseph tura . joseph ( jack benny ) specializes in overplaying hamlet and maria ( carole lombard ) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his " to be or not to be " speech . the man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation . although she is working for the allies , a nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause . madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess . the film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue and acting . it is a real shame that carole lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash ; she proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne .

carlos mencia is one edgy comedian ; i know this because he wo n't stop telling everyone about it . i 've never been a huge fan of carlos and after listening to this cd my opinion of him has n't really changed . he claims to be an edgy comedian and that 's his problem , if he was truly edgy he would n't have to constantly remind us in his cd / dvd titles , his show on comedy central , radio / tv interviews and most importantly during his own act . sure he talks about very racial and socially taboo subjects but so does chris rock , george lopez , david cross , george carlin , dave chappelle , richard pryor ( rip ) and countless other comedians and they are much better at it . in fact they are so good at it mr. mencia often feels to need to use some of these comedian 's jokes in his own act , a true sign of respect for those who came before them ; at least that 's what carlos seems to think or maybe he 's just plagiarizing because he 's not funny enough to come up with descent material . needless to say i was not laughing while listening to this cd and it was n't because i find carlos to mean spirited , or crass , or politically incorrect ; it 's because everything he talks about that 's supposed to be so gosh darn edgy has already been said by other people who are much more funny then he is . there is so much good stand up comedy out there people do n't waste your time and money on this joke stealing , self aggrandizing hack .

upgrading to the tz3 from a 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited a few months to purchase when i heard the tz1 was being updated . with the tz3 , panasonic has fixed the main complaints about the tz1 which were : no build in lens cover , noisy images at higher iso speeds . imo , the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the tz1. as others have said , this camera has a great build quality , easy operation , and a high-quality look . i ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when i opened the box . it has the look of a retro 35mm cartridge camera , which is cool . the chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , is first rate and looks great with the matte black case . the lcd is huge and bright . the camera 's " simple mode " does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable . the zoom is fantastic , but you need a really steady hand at full zoom , even with optical stabilization turned on . i did take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way in from my car as i came across a herd of deer . shot to shot speed is really great , unless you are using the flash . the red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i have used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you are looking for a great zoom camera in a small form factor , you should seriously consider the dmc-tz3

their 4th album as a complete group ( not counting the few album havoc & prode'je put out ) is my least favorite of the 4 scc albums i have ( i do n't have the one from 1992 or 2005 ) , but it still gets itself a 4 star rating . out of the 13 songs on here none are vclassics or worth skipping ; 4 are ok and the other 9 are good . like all their albums , guests are minimal and are on are on 2 of the 13 songs . production is mostly handled by prode'je ( as with all their albums ) he does get a little help from robert " fonksta " bacon & tomie mundie . a good album to have for scc fans but not their best work . #1 - 8 #2 - 8 #3 - 7.5 #4 - 7.5 #5 - 7 #6 - 8 #7 - 8.5 ( f / c-bo , spice 1 , prophet - -- - also on their " gangsta conversation " album ) #8 - 9 ( f / daz dillinger - - - good beat ) #9 - 8 #10 - 9 ( good beat , deeper song - - my favorite on here ) #11 - 8 #12 - 8 ( another deeper song ) #13 - 7.5 scc is - - - havikk , prode'je , havoc , l.v. , dj gripp , dj kaos check all my review

i just started taking this pill because i do n't have time to eat at the job i was previously at . it helped a lot ! ! i did lose 8 pound in 1 week . but when i started an office job , i had more than enough time to eat , but i still kept up with taking the pill . it helps with my hunger , it really does . i used to be so hungry and fill up my plate more than i can eat ! now since taking this pill i am sensible with my portions and do not rush to eat as if i 'm starving like before . i agree with one of the reviews , if you still eat when you 're not hungry , this pill will not help you . you have to have the in mind that you want to help yourself eat better , slower and sensible portions .

the population of hong kong is approximately 7 million people . i 'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie . usually when a movie runs over 2 hours , it 's because there 's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in . in the case of hard boiled , the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo 's desire to get into the guinness book of records for " most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture . " chow yun-fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay , and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff . he shoots ( usually with a pistol in each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture , while swinging from a rope , while sliding down a banister ( ! ) , while being hurled through the air by explosions . sometimes he even shoots while standing still . and he shoots , and shoots , and shoots . and the bad guys shoot , and shoot , and shoot . and yun-fat 's fellow cops shoot , and shoot , and - - you get the idea . there are some fine action scenes in this film , but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended . there was n't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine-gunned from the next , and it became painfully repetitious . personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled . there 's plenty of yun-fat 's balletic shoot-em-up action , but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire

i bought this for my wife so she could pull out the camera , turn it on , and take a nice photo . flash works well , unlike some reviews i 've read . battery life appears to be fine also . this is a small , light camera , measuring 3 1 / 2 " wide , 2 1 / 4 " tall , and 3 / 4 " deep when turned off . not exactly a credit card , but likely as close to one as you 're gonna get . camera opens up instantly , takes a nice photo whether with or without flash , battery life appears ok , and controls are easy to use- -either in figuring them out or using your fingers on them . nice big screen 2 1 / 4 by 1 1 / 2 , so you can easily see what 's going on- -a nice plus . this camera also has a nice " reminder " listing on the right of the display , so you can see flash setting ( on , off , etc. ) , iso setting for those of you that use that , and very nice way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus , self-timer , antishake , iso sensitivity , white background ( am i losing you yet ? ) , and so on . one point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most-likely-to-use to least-likely , so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera . i 've gotten some nice pictures with this , with and without flash . a nice pick . why not 5 stars ? cuz i 've also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices , although for the price this camera is fine and it 'd be one i 'd buy again , but it is n't the equal of dig cams with 6x optical zooms , separate iso settings , and all those other techie things that , frankly , are n't that important to a lot of users but which do need to be considered in a rating . do buy a carrying case , as i have done , so the camera does n't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small . i do n't have any " special fear " about this but it 's also easy to buy a small carrying case to stash this into , so why not do it ? as in all my reviews , i have no financial interest one way or the other in what i review . also , do n't forget you are likely to want a bigger memory card to store pix , and maybe a second battery to swap out when needed . consider these additional costs , but also consider these additional costs apply to any camera you buy .

myths are important , but they should not be labeled history . 1. george washington was not a great guerilla leader ; he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines- -just like the redcoats . washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops . 2. ronald reagan did not begin the nuclear " disarming " of the soviet union . eisenhower and kennedy tried , but ( lbj ? ) nixon and carter were able to bring the abm treaty , the salt treaties and he start treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals . reagan did have success with theater wrapons in europe , but the " big nukes " that could end civilization were already being cut back . this is an interesting book about reagan and peggy noonan , but some of the history cited is wrong

please be aware of this camera 's shock sensitivity i was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the second time . it 's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world . the result is it loses it 's ability to focus and zoom . it did n't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket , with the lens protruding , thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly . the first time it happened casio repaired it under warranty . the second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that 's more than 1 / 3 the original purchase price . i wo n't reinvest in a weak product . i 'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether

i installed norton antivirus 2007 immediately after installing windows vista , office 2007 and other software on a new computer . installation ran smoothly . liveupdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch . norton antivirus 2007 not only detects viruses , it detects spyware and rootkits as well . it has an inbound firewall , and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities . it does not protect against phishing , identity theft , or spam , nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection . when installed on windows vista , norton antivirus takes over for windows defender and the windows firewall . i did not expect the latter ; symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall . norton antivirus integrates well with windows security center . norton antivirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions . norton antivirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products . the only other product that i would use myself is mcafee virusscan , but i have always felt that norton antivirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system . for those of you installing norton antivirus 2007 as an upgrade , i would highly recommend that you first remove any existing norton security products using add / remove programs in the control panel . then , download and run the norton removal tool from the symantec site to make sure that it 's all gone . to see a comparison chart of the norton 2007 windows protection products as of this posting date , browse to symantec 's site , click on " norton 2007 products " under home products , click on related link " view all products " and then click " compare " next to pc security .

if you burn lots of calories in your activities , this high energy food could give you a lift . there are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar , which is advertised to be at least 70% organic . this bar is advertised to be for athletes first , and as a casual snack second . if you are overweight and trying to drop pounds , you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn . when i opened this bar i noticed that it looks like compressed goop . however , the compressed goop tastes pretty good . the texture is much like a granola bar , though more moist than a granola bar . the black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated . there are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor , which is a big plus . i was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial , which is an even bigger plus . one thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy , but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy . i guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process . in either case , vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product . the label also states that there may be traces of peanuts . this bar also contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber , which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar . there are also lots of vitamins and trace elements , which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements , in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing . clif bars could be a casual snack , but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities . if you fall into that category , which could include hiking , climbing , bicycling , running , jogging , and other similarly strenuous activities , then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package . enjoy !

i 've been using norton antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with norton internet security 2003. now that it 's time to renewal norton antivirus , i thought i switch to trend micro internet secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines . i like norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the taskmanager considering i was running a p3 500 laptop with 196mb on winxp pro , resources are valuable . also newer norton antivirus version were a hit and miss . after also reading reviews at amazon , i took the plunge with trend micro . my review of this product can be best summarize along with it 's relations to norton antivirus 2002 ( updated ) . pros of trend micro 2005 : 1. fastest virus scan i 've seen . i have not find any virus in my system yet whereas norton would fail in about .01% of the time ( i.e. one stalling virus every year ) . 2. check incoming and outgoing mail like norton 3. scan selected files as i chose just like norton 4. alert and block virus threats 5. monitor nearby wifi connection 6. $25 mail in rebate making the price net at $15. ( it 's been 2 months since i 've mailed it and not received it yet ) . 7. uses about 10mb of system background resources versus norton 's 30mb . cons against trend micro 2005 : 1. very annoying auto-virus update every day that i log on the internet . i only have a 56k connection and updating takes 5 minutes . i 'm not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so i would prefer to have a preference setting that i can choose myself . norton is not as annoying . 2. on a wifi network , trend micro firewall failed 5 of the gibson research shields up test . ports were open . norton internet firewall close all major holes except for the non-critical ones which was n't a big worry . i ended up disabling trend micro firewall and using the norton firewall instead as it 's a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection . 3. anti-spam and data protection were subpar as i got advertisements and pop-up from certain websites like west cost major newspaper . using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again . 4. still waiting for rebate . overall , i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 for it 's fast virus check and a separate norton internet firewall is the ideal combo for me . on it 's own merit , trend micro would be perfect only if ram and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but i would n't mind using norton if i had plentiful more ram .

gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie ( of course , it was just a product of its time- -the mid-60s- -it 's not a film trying to recapture the era..it is the era ) . still the storyline is slim and the going slow . interesting scenes appear here and there . the parts are definitely better than the whole . there 's an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should . actually , thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was . it 's subtle , i 'll grant you that . and a nice character study....and yet... . ? we were counting the minutes left in the film by the end ( " only 25 minutes left in the film and then we can get back to our lives !

i really wanted to give superman volume 3 a full 5 stars , but unfortunately the quality control of the dvd release is poor , hence the 1 star rating . the dvd set i purchased skipped at the green lantern episode . the replacement i got also skipped at the same place . in addition , the two-sided disc format with which all three dvd volumes have been released is a damage prone format . luckily i was able to get a full refund , but at this point i 'm not sure if or when i 'll try my chance at buying this set again . the lack of quality control is too bad , because volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series . if you are fortunate enough to get a dvd set free of defects , then you are really in for a treat . bruce timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to superman as they did on batman : the animated series . of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain darkseid throughout the series . it finally gets put front and center in several episodes of volume 3 , and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale . i felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story , but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series

i had another norelco shaver for the last 5 ( or more ) years . the difference in the shaves is striking . both less pain when my stubble is a little long and closer . however , the reason this shaver is cheaper is that there is 1 battery inside it instead of 2. i know this because i took it in to be " repaired " because i only got 8 shaves to a charge . i talked ( online ) with norelco and they said my shaver was broken . so , i looked up on the norelco site a local authorized repair shop . i took it in and the guy opened it up . he said it was one of the " cheap " versions that has 1 instead of 2 batteries . my old shaver , over most of its life , gave me 25 or so shaves before needing to be recharged . that 's quite a difference

the purpose of nessus is to provide an open source solution for network auditing on all unix like systems . this book not only details using nessus but also comes with a cd containing the program , as well as ethereal , snort , and newt ( a port of the program to the windows environment ) . what is a network assessment ? at its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment , services , applications , and vulnerabilities on that system . basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external . an internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the lan . nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either , or both of them . the authors do an excellent job of detailing installation , setup , and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report . one of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system . some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows , default passwords , backdoors , information leaks , and denial of service . the nessus scripting language is covered in detail in appendix a instead of the main portion of the book ; a choice i appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section . with open source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help . so , the authors include information on how to get help via the nessus user community , mailing lists , and archives . nessus network auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality

this cd is 100% pure junk ! the cd is sung by kids ! they have high-pitched voices that are n't even good enough to win the school talent show . the other singers are adults who have voices that are n't anything impressive , either . if the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better . stop this s****y music !

when i gave birth i had already bought packages of newborn huggies . they were horrible . i thought once my boys got older that maybe huggies would work then . nope . i 've tried huggies supreme and the cheap huggies . they are both made horribly and after your child goes in them once they sag so bad you have to go change them . i thought since everyone always talks about pull-ups that they would work once potty training time came around . wrong again . they leaked evertime he wore them . do not waste you money . i always ended up going back to the pampers swaddlers , cruisers , and training pants . pampers are the best .

considered one of coltrane 's ' searching ' periods , this cd has a lot to offer in the way of understanding trane 's restless nature . never one to stand on laurels , coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar ' higher ' every time out . this one is mostly ballad and blues based , with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the trane spectrum . track #2 , " i love you " finds him playing furious , cerebral runs on the instrument , and , frankly , not as ' listenable ' as one may like ; whereas the track with donald byrd is as ' in the pocket ' as you 'll ever hear . all in all , a very realistic look at a genius in motion

dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it . dragonart : how to draw fantastic dragons and fantasy creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper . dragonart is divided into three major parts , fantastic dragons , unique details , and other fantasy creatures , along with an introduction , a section on how to use the book , and a brief guide to fantastic creatures . lessons in this book are progressive in nature , beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design , all illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout . and author / artist jessica " neondragon " peffer has a clear , easy writing style that can be easily comprehended , absorbed , and acted upon , an example of which follows below . " okay , so we 're going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds . sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct , but that will happen if your creature does n't look believable . to help make your dragon as real as possible , base its structure on real creatures , " she writes at one point ( page 44 ) . " the ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat , bird , and reptile body types . the trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out . you want it to feel like a single creature . " this advice , incidentally , is very reminiscent of that given by leonardo da vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk , making peffer well read or naturally very insightful , either of which speaks well for her . under " how you should make an imaginary animal look natural , " the increasingly famous renaissance man writes , " you know that you cannot invent animals without limbs , each of which , in itself , must resemble those of some other animal . hence if you wish to make an animal , imagined by you , appear natural - - let us say a dragon , take for its head that of a mastiff or hound , with the eyes of a cat , the ears of a porcupine , the nose of a greyhound , the brow of a lion , the temples of an old cock , the neck of a water tortoise . " dragonart also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures , including basilisks , chimeras , gargoyles , and griffins . for those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book , a companion dragonart kit : how to draw & paint fantastic creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon . author peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art website neondragonart.com , which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves .

young jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper ; yet , he is a motivational speaker . so , in this case , he is trying to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and carrying guns is the cool thing to do . he should just consider himself a rapper ; that way , when he 's using grade-school rhyme patterns to get his message across , we can just call him a bad rapper instead of a bad role model . anyways , with that diatribe aside , this album is nothing new from jeezy . we all saw it coming . he picks out some great beats , but cannot provide the great lyrics to go along with them . therefore , an uneven album ensues . " i luv it " was the first single and is a prime example . if this beat might have reached someone such as t.i. or maybe even a group like clipse , this would 've been a great song . however , it 's jeezy , so it 's gonna be a letdown . that 's pretty much what this album is ; a letdown . after guest spots on " grew up a screw up " with ludacris and the posse cut remix " top back " with t.i. & b.g. , i was expecting alot from jeezy this time around . however , all i got were two tracks ( " go getta " with r . kelly & " 3 a.m. " with timbaland ) that are recommendable . the rest of the album is plagued with horrible lyrics over average-to-above average production . if you 're looking for " inspiration , " look away from this " trap-star .

many people criticized this movie for having no plot . which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex . there 's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain . dougray scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of scottish actors . john woo uses some wonderful australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes . the gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow-motion , which robs them of any realism or hardcore . seeing as how this is a pg-13 the action is also pretty damn tame . which is a shame since woo is a pro at this . you hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit . it 's all done off screen . if people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire woo to direct ? it 's a bit puzzling . although it is tame it is still darker and harder than the original . but the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap . i ca n't believe robert towne had a hand in writing this . it 's like a rejected plot to a solid snake ps1 game . there 's seems to be some focus on making it a james bond / die hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces . another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is zimmer 's score . for a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music . zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music . but none of that is present in mi-2. this was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced soulless stuff . which is also a shame . it 's the wrong plot , the wrong director and the wrong approach that turns this into a movie for idiots . they really under-estimated the audience and fumbled the ball with this one . john woo 's original cut was 3.5 hours long . none of that footage is on this new ' special edition ' dvd . what a waste

i read bill bryson 's " a walk in the woods " and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book , and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated ( for the " educated " aspect , bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents ) . i started into " in a sunburned country " with similar expectations , and especially since i have always longed and planned to visit australia . to state that i was disappointed is a severe understatement . after reading this book i now have little to no desire to visit the " land down under ; " my only hope is that i will completely forget what i read in bryson 's book so that i may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting australia . ( senility be merciful and consume me hastily ! ) my best estimate is that bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about australia . during and / or after his trip , his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own . i have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as i did with this one . bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a " story " relayed second-hand from one of the australians he " met . " such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books . the only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents . these , at least , provided for some interesting reading . after comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of bryson 's books ( " i 'm a stranger here myself " ) after she read " a walk in the woods , " it would appear that " in a sunburned country " is not the only snore-fest that bryson has churned out . perhaps he is n't a " one hit wonder , " but i for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out . so , if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that bryson provided in " a walk in the woods , " look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed .

feeling more than a bit fleeced by mcafee 's overpriced " subscription " renewal every year , i decided to give kaspersky a try . installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks . then one day my computer would not boot- --just stalled on a blank screen right after the windows xp splash screen . when trying to boot up in safe mode , a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen . it stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever . a little research at work showed that this was a kaspersky file . it may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program , but i doubt it . attempts to use a recovery disk failed . a trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives ( which were in the inscrutable raid 0 format ) could not be recovered ( unless i wanted to ship them to a recovery shop , and nothing on them was worth that much ) . so they 're going to reinstall windows , i 'll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when i finally get my computer back , and , yes , i 'll lose all the data that was on there . ( gee , good thing i backed up all the kids ' photos- --well , most of them . thanks , kaspersky ! ) anyway , perhaps my attempts at recovering the os caused the worst of this . whatever the case , i believe the boot failure was caused by either the kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus . who knows . kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios . i do know one thing : i am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again . and kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail . i got an automated " we received your e-mail " response , but nothing more , even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two . that was over a week ago . if in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me , then i still do not apologize for the one-star rating , given their horrible customer service . if you decide i 'm insane or that this was just a fluke , at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product . that might mean the difference between losing data / spending $$$ and just being inconvenienced . and do n't expect much assistance from kaspersky should things go wrong .

i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i was n't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning . but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much . once he did start playing , gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in . by the time things settle down , the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface . the mix is horrible . the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize , he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out . i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the " concert experience " . there are high points in the show , but the low points are rock bottom . comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart . two versions are provided on this dvd - from the concert and in the bonus section . neither of the guest singers ( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff ) know the words , have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before . gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience . the very best thing on this dvd is , oddly enough , in the bonus section . screamin ' jay hawkins ' i put a spell on you , a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland , almost makes the dvd worth buying . almost . watch jonathan demme 's beautiful treatment of neil young : heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show . that is the gold standard .

this software is wonderful ! i have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years . i 've tried broderbund ( sp ? ) whose interface was too clumsy , nova which was rather difficult at times ( many things you ca n't do ) and now this . when i first took this out of the package and installed it i thought i had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very , very few backgrounds , templates or embellishements even when i opened the xtras cds that came with this . i truly did not feel the xtras cds were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them . but then i found the tutorials that are included on the cd and watched the one about making collages . i did n't get halfway through the video - i had figured out how to do it . i have now created some of the best scrapbook pages i 've ever made . within hours i had a beautiful collage / letter to send with my holiday cards . my husband 's first impression was a heartfelt " it 's lovely " . what has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that i can take any image and make it a background , i can create and manipulate text almost any way i want , i 've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it ( .png format ) . i feel like i have no limitations on what i can do now . i imagine this software is not as sophistacated as adobe illustrator , but then it probably is n't as complicated to use ( from what i remember that program has a rather steep learning curve ) . you can also use the eyedropper tool to " pick up " any color from any picture , background , or element ( read " anything " ) in the program . i was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched ! i can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches . you can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do , but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses . you can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing , etc. there are so many more features i could n't possibly list them here , nor would you want me too ( too much time ) . if you only use premade templates and do n't feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software . you could start with something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 , which i liked , and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program . you may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities . the great thing about this program is that it is n't just for scrapbooking . you can do all your photo manipulation in it . i have always liked paint shop pro so much that i have n't been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6 , but i kept using that version . i 'm so glad i got version 10 as it is very user friendly too . but please know that version 10 ( which comes with this package ) is not the most recent version . version 11 is out now . if you do n't want / need the xtras cds that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files ( portable network graphics format ) or make your own . i hope you have as much fun with this software as i am having . i highly recommend the training videos on the cd - they really help

i have used corel draw since it was draw 5 or 6 , i ca n't exactly recall for certain so i guess some would consider me a software guru . i have also used other top level design tools and can tell you the fact is the corel draw suite x3 is a robust design suite that has a very palatable learning curve . the scope of what you can do with the software is amazing so certainly there is a new set of words to add to one 's vocabulary however with terms like pick tool , rectangle tool , ellipse tool , and the like , i believe that it is pretty logical to get an idea of what the tools do just by allowing the mouse pointer to rest over the tool for about three seconds so the application can display the tool name and even the shortcut key to select the tool . the icons also give a pretty clear visual representation of what the tool will do e.g. a capital a is the text tool and guess what you do with it ... it allows you to add paragraph text , and artistic text . after you learn a bit about the text tool you also see that it allows you to place text in your document on a path . the text on a path is just that.. . text on any path in your document . this can be a freehand line , an ellipse , a circle , or any other shape you care to make . how many of you have ever wanted to put your text in an arch ? in corel draw you simply make an ellipse with the ellipse tool , choose the text tool from the tool box , move the mouse pointer over to the ellipse and the mouse cursor changes to the text on a path icon and you click the left mouse button . now you type whatever you want around the shape that you have created . if the text is not the size , color , font , or position you want you can change it , color it , or move it simply by selecting the pick tool . i have developed a program to teach technology skills to middle & high school students with various disabilities in 46 sites throughout oklahoma and the corel draw suite is the first software application the students use . do the students know how to do everything with the software after the first week , or fourth , or tenth ? no , but if it took a week to learn it would not be a design tool in would be something like print shop pro where almost everything is done for you and you just type in the text . there is nothing wrong with psp but if you want to truly be creative , if you want to have the ability to design anything that you can see in your minds eye , then the corel draw suite is the tool you want . my program has a website that shows some of the work the students in the program have created . just do a search for tech-now oklahoma high school high tech and you should be able to find the site . the section on weekly curriculum is a pretty good place to start but i encourage you to look around . almost everything you will see on the site was created by the students using the corel draw suite . corel draw is a program that can be used in a matter of minutes but is as deep as you can possibly want to go .

as you can see by other reviews above , the studio series has a history of being buggy . you also hear a lot of people saying " this package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other ' powerful enough to be worth owning ' packages - - if only it were more stable ! " i am one of those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back to version 9 ) , and finally with version 10.6 i have stopped complaining - - it now works as i 'd hoped when i bought it . the $300 i spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted - - i kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual could n't clarify . and i 'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures . i am turning all of our old family video tapes and cd 's into dvd's . i use studio for all the editing ( have not tried the dvd recording - - just use roxio for that ) and am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download . one important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems : put every " project " you work on in a separate subdirectory . if you have 5 soccer game videos make a / game1 , / game2 etc. series of subfolders . if you edit those to a " jimmy 's great plays " proect , put it in a separate / jimmyplays folder . when projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5. i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , and i do n't know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why did i stick with something where i admit that version 9.0 was " powerful but unstable " and 10.0 was " more powerful and more unstable " ? because i can actually use studio with minimal reference to instructions , and when i use it things turn out as i expect . now that it has become stable and reliable i am a very satisfied customer . so that 's how i got from being a frustrated studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review . i tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions , but that " 10.5 updated for free to 10.6 " really is the best choice out there now.. . as my unused expensive rivals to studio on my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder !

as a lover of gospel bluegrass i anticipated an enjoyable listening session with blue highway 's latest offering . let me first say that i am a fan of this group , which i consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom , but what i heard was bluegrass muzak . yes , the group 's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence , and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller , but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing . gospel music , even bluegrass gospel , has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves . a good gospel recording must have some cuts which are humorous , some serious and contemplative , some that push the envelope of orthodoxy , and most importantly it must have an element of fun in order to keep the attention of the listeners . this disc fails in that regard containing standard old gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards . my advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new , or buy used . want mine

i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama . and that 's exactly what i got . the story was very interesting to me . i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers , especially lucious and ivy . the scary moments just added to the drama . having grown up in the country , i know how scary the woods can be . i loved all the twists to the story . the only thing i did n't like was william hurt 's performance . it was too hammy . i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor , the movie would 've moved along at a better pace . but still a great movie

in 1995 the poverty level for a family of four in the united states was $19 , 806. 37 million people in the us live at or below this level . ron sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth . in just generosity , sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in america . and it is a compelling vision . sider 's vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society 's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals . both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty . drawing upon biblical study , sider presents the goal of an economy of justice : " every person or family has access to productive resources ( land , money , knowledge ) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community " ( 81 ) . sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare , minimum wage , tax credits , health care , and education reform , showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work , empower the poor , and strengthen families . sider ends with this troubling question : do enough christians really care ? this book should be required reading for any that do .

alfred hitchcock 's second film after being brought to america by david o . selznick was suspicion , which he made while on loan to rko pictures . as in his first hollywood flick , rebecca , he put joan fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star . fontaine won the best actress academy award for her portrayal of lina mclaidlaw , a bookish and innocent ( but wealthy ) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish johnnie aysgarth ( cary grant ) . after their quick courtship and marriage against her father 's wishes , lina begins to see johnnie for who he really is- -a penniless leech- -but she naively continues to love him nonetheless . johnnie 's charm is ostensible , yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable . lina 's trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts . hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture . the movie 's only flaw is its tacked-on and seemingly contrived final scene which , we are told , was due either to mr. grant 's popularity during these years or to the existence of the production code in effect in hollywood at that time . hitchcock wanted a darker ending but , as we see here , he lost that battle . however , he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe . the ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities . suspicion is classic hitchcock . grant and fontaine turn in masterful performances and nigel bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable " beaky , " johnnie 's old chum . the flawed ending prevents placing suspicion at the top of any list of hitchcock 's achievements , but it is a fine film nevertheless and i can only give it my highest recommendation . jeremy w . forstad

i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti . i found the subject interesting , and the professor gave wonderful lectures . i had good expectations about this book going in , but those quickly soured as i read it . it seems correct , at least , about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock . not that such is a particularly daunting feet . however , it is rife with laughable fallacies . for instance , it calls david bowie , amongst other glam rock bands of the era , metal . it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock , when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all , such as the carpenters . i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore . bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap . further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book . i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs . for instance , it claims ' thunder rolls ' by garth brooks is about domestic violence . its about infedility , not focusing on violence at all , but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on . the writing is also rather dry . many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence . it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band 's successes or failures . after reading the book in completetion , i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues ( 50s to 60s ) that i had thought were true . in the end , i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything

i really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great . a shocking murder is committed in the town of newpointe , then another . meanwhile , fireman mark branning has moved out and is separated from his wife allie . there is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and allie and mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage . i wanted to like this book because it is a christian novel with a good purpose . ninety percent of the books i 've read have been secular but i 'm starting to read more christian novels . but to me , this book fails for three reasons : the marriage conflict between mark and allie is n't believable , the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight , and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing . mark and allie 's marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he has n't convinced her otherwise . seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery , but it is grounds for suspicion . yet , allie assumes mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman . it seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight . instead , mark and allie separate and allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair . blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between mark and allie . throughout the book , references are made to allie believing mark had an affair with issie . allie refers to mark 's act as " adultery " and recalls him " lying " his way out of it after allie caught him hugging issie . their marriage is struggling , but blackstock should have given more reasons why allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book , mark says he did n't have an affair and allie chalks it up to one of his lies . later in the novel , blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late . the serial killer story is poorly done , and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book . when they book a suspect at the end , it seems ridiculous . the police work feels like it was written by an amateur . one line in the novel , " as much as the evidence pointed to xxx , stan did n't want to believe it . " in my opinion , the evidence did n't point to that person and stan , the detective , seems foolish for believing it . there is n't any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story . there is no sense of setting in the book . there are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other . finally , this book talks about god and prayer and being " saved " throughout the book , and that 's great . with a serial killer on the loose , a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way . at one point , a conversation goes like this : " how can the murder be part of god 's plan ? " " maybe it is n't " " that would mean god is n't in control . " " he is in control , but he allows some things to happen . " then at another point , mark says to allie , " i 'm going to be fine , it 's time to trust the lord . he 's taken care of us so far . " then allie says : " but i do n't know what his plan is . i do n't know how he wants this to end . i do n't know what he wants to teach us . " at other points in the book , characters say that god has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of god 's plan and that through god 's plan , all things can be used for good . this line of logic is infuriating . bad things happen to everyone , including god 's people . god does n't " allow " a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife . that 's a horrible message to send to a non-christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck . telling them it was part of god 's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from god . god is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and god can even keep bad things from happening to christians . but like above , where allie was afraid because she thought god might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson , god does n't willfully kill people . it comes down to the simple fact that all people , including serial killers and christians , have choices to make and have free will . i 'm surprised i wrote so much on an 8 year old book but i wanted it to be a good book .

generally , my eyes glaze over as i reach chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of the intuitively obvious . make your own luck by shapiro and stevenson has broken the pattern . written in punchy conversational style , the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision-making . the process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects , allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure . this sounds as if it could be tedious , but it 's not . the authors know you are not sitting in a policy course . they know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time without focusing on the decision as a bet . the book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus . in managing investments , i 'm betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors . the tools in make your own luck , such as the prediction map , are completely applicable to the inferential analysis i use in managing investments as well as life 's major problems , such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party . this book is a good read . shapiro and stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the metropolitan museum of art. make your own luck makes you laugh , makes your think and gives you tools to improve your own lot .

i installed this unit in my basement about 6 months ago , and it has been working flawlessly ever since . things i noticed : if the power goes out , the unit will not turn back on automatically ( as some other units do . ) if you want to use the continuous drainage ( which i highly recommend ) via a hose , you have to punch out a plastic disc on the side of the unit . i would have designed a screw-type plug that was replacable , but they did n't think of that . anyway , once you punch the quarter-size disc out it 's out forever . if you choose to use the continuous drainage feature , you will need to pick up a hose with an inner diameter of 15mm ( .59 " or just over half an inch . ) i went to the local diy center and found some clear tubing that has worked well . the unit can operate down to 2-degrees c ( 36-degrees f ) , which will be great for continuous operation in the garage to keep the tools from rusting . has three fan settings : med , high and quiet . " quiet " really is quiet , and could probably work just fine in a bedroom . though , it does warm the room it 's in . how much it warms it depends on the humidity setting . four settings : the humidty level ( humidstat ) can be set to " continuous dehumidification " ( which is the default setting ) , 50% , 60% and 70%. the fan will continue to run but the dehumidification processor will turn off when it reaches the selected humidity level . cool . i mean , that 's when the fan will just blow room-temp air . a full drainage tank will stop the unit and illuminate a " tank full " indicator light . the unit is not that heavy - - maybe for some , but not nearly as heavy as some people make it sound . it 's 30.8 pounds . according to the instructions : you will need at least 21 cm ( about 8 inches ) of clearance in front , behind and side to side . air blows out of the top of the unit , so you 'll need to make sure it 's clear as well . there are movable louvers on the top to direct the air straight up , 45-degrees or almost straight ahead . power consumption : cfm-25e is 220w / / cfm-40e is 330w i highly recommend this model dehumidifier

having been a fan of antonia fraser for many years , i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie-antoinette , but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual . she depicts marie-antoinette 's mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married , but arranged marriages were the norm ; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary . what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen , of which there is little concrete evidence , but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant . it seems to me that marie-antoinette loved children so much ; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more . she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable , unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes . in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france . if marie-antoinette had been caught in adultery , it would have been considered treason ; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her . with all of her enemies at court , that was not a risk she would have taken , if she had been so inclined . on a smaller scale , fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie-antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that i have seen of her , her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age ; i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it . not that that is a big deal ; but it makes me wonder where lady fraser 's life ends and where marie-antoinette 's life begins . i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie-antoinette 's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy , when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king . especially , since marie-antoinette 's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor . sadly , there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language . one can only hope that the works of bertieres , chalon , and delorme will soon be translated and published in english . fraser 's book does have some interesting details ( aside from those which flow from her imagination ) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever 's travesty

' now i 've seen ' the perfect storm ' twice , and i own the book , but i still have n't read it because i 'm reasonably sure the book must suck if the movie is this bad . and i 'm sorry new england , but what are gloucestermen anyways , except for great rapers of the high seas ? what will they not do for a buck , you might ask . ok , they are not as bad as the japanese , but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there 's no tomorrow . watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu . sure you will find excitement aplenty , amped up to eleven . even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history . i even like some of the principal actors , but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be . this just does n't stand up to repeat viewings . unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker . do you

i was blown away by the wonderful acting of juliet lewis and giovanni ribisi who played the retarded young adults . this was a very compassionate film about the realities of living with a disability . disabled people desire and deserve to have the same opportunities as everyone else . it was wonderful to see the love " carla " ' s siblings and parents had for her . there were 2 reasons i did n't give this movie 5 stars . one was that diane keaton 's character of the overly controlling mother was annoying . obviously she was supposed to be annoying , but i think she overacted a bit and she needed better lines , she seemed to say the same stuff over and over again . another reason i did n't love this film was because hollywood once again compels right wing nut jobs to write reviews that portray themselves as normal and good . sorry , hollywood , but there will always be those of us who still believe god 's word to be true . being a right wing nut job is n't considered normal or ok in the bible . god never created it . look it up . you are not helping people who struggle with it to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle .

american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree . i read the human stain a few years ago , and it was good . but , in pastoral , the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst , and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst , but absent the psychoanalyst : roth is our psychoanalyst . what he misses , however , is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control . the swede never failed as a father ; rather , he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her

the boston based author , dennis lehane , wrote a great detective story with a social background so great , it is almost more important than the plot . " mystic river " differs from lehane 's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer . " mystic river " is set in the fictional boston suburb , called east buckingham ( the author explains it as an amalgamate of dorchester , charlestown and south boston and it really feels like dorchester ) , home mostly to white working class , with plenty of crime . i liked the background info especially since i could relate to it , knowing the area.. . the first part , which is the base and explanation for later events , takes place in 1975 , when one of the three eleven-year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple-smelling car , and although he comes back after four days , his life as well as his friends ' is changed forever . the ways of the boys soon part , dave ( the boy taken by the men ) lives a quiet life , has a wife and a son , and likes his memories of being a football player in high school . jimmy , the " bad boy " , after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage , second wife and their two daughters . the third boy , college-educated sean , becomes a policeman . when jimmy 's beautiful daughter , katie , is found murdered in the park after a night out dave comes home covered in blood , sean gets assigned to the case . there are many leads to different people.. . but the case is difficult . meanwhile , jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own . the plot is very good until the end , and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate . the characters are very real , especially jimmy and sean , who are central to the plot . their trauma after dave 's abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways . they are complicated , multifaceted people , very well developed as literary characters . some side protagonists , depicting perhaps types rather than individuals ( bobby , roman , the savage brothers , sergeant whitey ) , are very good . i was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great entertainment , but also food for thought . the movie based on " mystic river " with sean penn is equally moving - recommended for those with little time.. .

one only needs to watch ball of fire to realize the depth of barbara stanwyck 's incredible talent . i 'd match her up against any actress of her era or any other era ! ! here is a woman who can rip your heart out...even when she plays unlikeable characters because she always lets you see multi-dimensions of her characters . sugarpuss o'shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive , good-looking gentleman . but she also shows her love to the other professors . 1941 was stanwyck 's greatest movie year.....she made " meet john doe " and " the lady eve " in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them . stanwyck is the only actress i can think of who can do anything ! ! from drama to comedy , to musicals and of course westerns ! ! while stanwyck 's singing is not on a par with her other talents ( her singing was dubbed in ball of fire ) she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her 1937 film ( this is my affair where she plays a vaudeville entertainer ) . bette davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting . she could n't sing or dance ( as barbara did in ball of fire , lady of burlesque , this is my affair and banjo on my knee ) . katharine hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms , high patrician attitude and she could never play a part in a musical . she could n't sing ) . joan crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she could n't sing . doris day was brilliant in comedy , musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy . the same with judy garland . rare is the talent who could do it all . i dare anyone to disagree with me that stanwyck was the one who could do it all....drama , comedy , westerns , musicals ! ! heroine or villainess ! stanwyck 's work is always first class even when applied to material that is not . she was simply the greatest and i 'm sorry this review has turned into a tribute to stanwyck but she should have won the oscar in 1941 for ball of fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses ! ! the movie , ball of fire is great fun ! ! from beginning to end stanwyck and cooper are unbeatable ! ! ! and the other professors are hilarious to watch as well ! ! there is also a marvelous musical score and the production values are top notch !

i bought this camera for myself during christmas 2004. it was suppose to be a utility camera , ebay items and class projects for the kids only- -i do n't trust digital cameras for family photos . the kodak cx7300 seemed to fit the bill ; inexpensive , easy to use and with more than enough resolution at 3.2mp . the flaw in this camera did n't appear until i pulled it out of the drawer some months later . the camera would n't turn on . i checked the batteries and they were in excellent shape . i eventually tried replacing the batteries and , sure enough , that worked . the next time i took out the camera , the exact same thing happened . and the time after that . at first , i thought the cx7300 was eating the batteries . but eventually i came to the conclusion that the camera does n't eat batteries , it nibbles at them . it wo n't run on anything but brand-spanking-new batteries . the kodak batteries that came with the cx7300 are still in my mini-mag flashlight , going strong . i contacted kodak about this flaw . they wanted to talk about what kind of batteries i 'm using- -kodak- -or the option of my purchasing a camera dock and some rechargeable batteries . a solution that would increase my investment by about seventy-five percent . i thought that buying an optional ac adapter would be the simple , and cheap , solution . surprise , surprise , the cx7300 is one of the few digital cameras kodak makes that does n't take one . so , now that i 'm way past warranty , what do i do with it ? i 'm shopping for another camera

i echo the comments of the previous reviewers . do n't waste your money . not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual u2 fan , it ca n't even get those facts right ! the book states that bono 's father dropped the family off at a catholic church before driving himself to another church . this contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that bob hewson was catholic , while bono , his mother and brother were protestant . in the same paragraph the dublin neighborhood of " glasnevin " is misspelled " asnevin " . the hearing aid shop from which bono took his name is misspelled , and perhaps most galling of all , the author ca n't even get the full name of larry mullen , jr. right ! and this is just chapter one ! i have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing . i would suggest skipping this one and purchasing bono : in conversation with michka assayas , which includes a pretty good account of bono 's life from the man himself .

truly the author 's pen is mightier than the sword as he takes on christmas , parents , children , evangelical christians from kentucky , television , macy 's , the result of a dalliance during the viet nam war , and " keeping up with the joneses " . this short book is much funnier than his best-selling " me talk pretty some day " as the author 's humorous cynicism is at its best . one ca n't put it down for fear of missing some insight into the american psyche . three of the stories appear to be autobiographical ( with obvious changes made to " protect the innocent " ) wherein the author " tells " the others in the guise of another . regardless , sedaris pulls no punches and will have the reader in stitches , even if there 's a little guilt attached to that feeling .

i wrote this review because i felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book . this is not a book about cosmology ( as people would expect from roger penrose ) . in this tiny book , penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes ( something much different from the opinion of 99 , 99% of neurobiologists , such as steven pinker ) . this view is near to the nobel laureate murray gell-mann . the book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories ( thus , the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works ! ) . some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they did n't had in mind that this book is about penrose 's point of view on intelligence . in fact , i 'm not a physicist , nor a biologist , simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand , although i do not agree with penrose 's point of view . i think he forgot something very important . read it and read the other point of view and you 'll find what it is ! :

i waited over 30 years to see this film , and now that i have - - i 'm glad i waited that long . its glaring defects might not have been so obvious to me 30 years ago . nicholas , alexandra , their daughters , their son , the people surrounding them - - not only are they not fictional , but thanks to the era in which they lived , they were photographed , we know what they actually looked like . so who on earth did the casting ? ! it was impossible to tell one grand duchess from another , and as for alexandra - - in the first few scenes , i had trouble distinguishing the actress from someone in drag . janet suzman was the worst casting flub of all , unless you count the stilted manner in which michael jayston delivered his lines . what a stiff and boring character he makes nicholas to be . yet there are photos extant of nicholas smiling as he played with his children . nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his power as tsar . but in the robert massie book after which the movie was purportedly modeled , it was very clear that nicholas was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the russian people , as well as to his family , and above all his son , the future tsar . there was nothing exceptional about his behavior ; most of europe at the time was ruled by kings and queens , and to all of them , the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable . yet this film falls into the trap most of us do , of judging history not on the basis of its own terms , but with our usual spectacularly accurate 20 / 20 hindsight . having been fed soviet propaganda for 75 years , we have it entrenched in our minds that nicholas was an extremely poor ruler . that 's the stunning success of the massie book , that someone who had absolutely no connection to russians , and no connection to royalty save for the one coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia , was able to overcome the general ( and erroneous ) " knowledge " of his time and write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was long lacking . the movie , on the other hand , makes nicholas look petty , and alexandra slightly over the edge . one petty anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying just prior to nicholas 's sending off his troops into world war i . it was badly researched , to the point of ludicrousness . the tsars of russia were all orthodox christians . orthodox christianity has its own very distinctive music ; in fact , russian orthodox chant is very different from greek orthodox chant . so what kind of background music did the director choose ? gregorian , of course ! can we at least *strive* for a little authenticity ? ! apparently not . massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of the romanovs towards their captors , how their guards had to be changed every three or so months because they kept winning over the bolsheviks : " you are n't anything like what we thought , " was the most frequently quoted comment on the subject . the movie showed nothing of that . well - - in the end , it was this exact trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors that ended up getting the romanov family canonized in the russian orthodox church . that movement was well underway by 1971 ; i wonder , if the directors and producers had done a little more thorough research , if the film would have been a tad more sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and two cultures . all in all , purchasing the movie was a waste of money . maybe the bolsheviks over at the university 's russian department will appreciate my donating it - - that way , others can get to see it without wasting their money

by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in 86 years . it 's true , the patriots somehow pieced together a team that , despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a 17-2 record ( which just as easily could have / should have been 18-1 ) ...but the 2004 boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 patriots season just does n't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003. part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities ( 2001 having 9 / 11 , the coming-of-age of tom brady , the snow bowl , and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever . 2003 had the release of lawyer milloy , the early stumbles to buffalo and washington , the birth of the winning streak , winter weather in foxboro , and yet another thrilling super bowl finish ) ; 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison , like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the " w " on the patriots ' side of the field . this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries ( leading to the incredible " throwback " two-way play of veteran wide receiver / rookie cornerback troy brown ) , the continued winning streak , the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon , the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts , and the return to pittsburgh ( where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween ( just days after the red sox won the world series , karmically enough ) , where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl , this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville , fl . no nail-biting endings this time , though...despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else ( with the possible exception of curt schilling , of course ) , the eagles all-pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day ( safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick , actually ) and the patriots , though trailing early , never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved . far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another super bowl ring should be considered hum-drum , but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that , impressive as it was , just does n't translate to the memorable re-telling that the pats ' previous title years do . this is a great dvd for pats fans , indispensible even , but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring , i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd 's over this one

this product will only display 142 photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card . this little fact is n't mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual ( hidden from consumer ) . i initially loaded 1 , 400 photos onto a 128mb card and was shocked to only see 142 displayed . a firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to 250 , but i could never get the file to load into the frame . another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music . it would have been nice to hear a random music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on . definitely not worth the price . shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback

i have this program on a 30-day demo . it might be ok if i did n't mind my computer becoming almost unusable . i tried to run the system virus scan , as recommended , but after 3 hours it was only 2% done because it was stuck on a file it could n't seem to get past . i skipped the file , but then it quickly got stuck again . the " time remaining " said it would take 4 days to complete , so i cancelled that scan . it has a learning mode that initally blocks everything . apparently , this program has no brain . for example , i have the live search toolbar installed in outlook . it had to ask me if it was ok to run that dll file . in fact , each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run . do n't even get me started on the quickbooks and internet explorer problems . which is what it would n't let those programs do , even after they had been run and i repeated clicked " allow " over and over . twice today it got so slow running ie that it finally crashed the computer so bad that i had to do a hard re-boot . if you have it checking ports on your computer , almost nothing would run or download on ie . so , i 'm going to demo a few more , but it 's probably back to windows live onecare , which i had the past year . it just does n't seem to do much ( no long list of features ) , but it also does n't jam everthing else up

reasons to buy it : 1. cheap , a mere $140. 2. packed with features . from complete auto mode ( point and shoot ) to fully manual mode . 4mp and 3x optical zoom good enough for most situations . 3. picture quality is good . it 's better than the other two cameras i own ( olympus c720 uz and sony dsc s600 ) . 4. compact . it 's smaller than it looks in the stock photo . 5. fast . switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds . other things i liked about the camera : - good ergonomics . fits nicely in my hand , all the buttons are well placed and easy to access . i can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand . - powerful flash . enough to fill up a moderate size room . - great video mode with sound . it also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your tv and watch the vidoes and pictures on your tv . - lcd is decent size and is fairly bright , which means it 's even visible outdoors in the daytime . things i did n't like about the camera : - manual could be more detailed . there is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide . but there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail . - the auto focus illuminator ( for help in focussing in low light ) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes . but the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions . - does not come with a battery charger . i bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately . i have owned the olympus c720 uz and the newer sony dsc s600 , but i think this camera is better than both of them .

this just arrived thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far . i am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so i wo n't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls , etc. i agree closely with the other two reviews so i wo n't repeat their details . i 'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the hc7 to the sony hc90 , an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 mp stills . i have taken about one hour of hd video so far , and have viewed it through an hdmi cable on a sony 46 " xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured a few indoor scenes , a few neighborhood outdoor scenes , and some footage at harper 's ferry in west virginia - river , mountain , and two trains passing by at close range while i was at the railroad station there . i can say comfortably that you wo n't confuse the video from this camcorder with standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they are n't kidding . if your tv can show the video off to advantage and you 've grown fond of hd , i think you 'd be pleased with this camcorder . in my case , the overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders was to get the hd video , so this has made it worth the steep expense . my second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so i only have to carry one piece of equipment around . i already had this in the sony hc90 at 3mp , so going up to 6mp was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself . my only output criticisms so far are that the west virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than i remember . i did n't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt . these camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which i have not explored . one or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage , and i 'm not unhappy with what i think i noticed in the slightest . the stills look very good to me so far , but i 've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the tv . i normally view stills on a pc . i do n't have a telephoto lens yet so i ca n't report on the quality of the stabilization . i used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video . i was very pleased , by the way , with how well the camera did with the moving trains . very crisp where i expected a fair bit of motion blur . lcd size and controls have been mentioned in first looks . i 'm perfectly happy with a 2.7 " lcd instead of the larger one in the ux7. so this was n't a negative for me personally . the controls ( menus ) are highly similar to those of the sony hc90 i already have . if you have n't seen them before , there 's a learning curve . if you have the hc90 or another camcorder with those menus , you 'll be right at home with the hc7. one note : you can configure p[ersonal]-menus to include the things you use the most in your own order , in addition to the camcorder 's menus . one thing i forgot is that each mode ( video , camera , play / edit ) has its own configurable personal menu . so i was looking for things to add to the play / edit personal menu that i was sure should be configurable , but could n't find them . that was because they belonged only to the filming side , not to the playback side . so you 've got three personal menus you can create , not one . battery : check the sizes on the batteries . the hc90 batteries were very thin . i think three of the batteries for the hc7 fit entirely within its case . the fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that i thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1 / 2 " or so . the other three will fit flush into the back of the camera , though they 're not behind a door or anything . battery life : my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate , but the batteries drain faster than that of the hc90. this is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones . the ccds and the stills and everything are all " more " than in the hc90. so i think i 'm fine with the battery life , but you 'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery . size compared to the hc90 : this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the hc90. it 's maybe 1 / 2 " longer front to back , and wider as well . i think the hc7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder i see in best buy . but it 's noticeably smaller than last year 's sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i do n't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like i did with the hc90 , but it 's pretty light and still fits in the case i used for the hc90 if i do n't load other stuff in there . fit in the hand : i found a best buy with an hc5 and ux5 on hand and played with both at the same time . these have the same footprint as the hc7 and ux7 as far as i can tell . the hc5 's tape case is maybe 3 / 8 " wider than the ux5 's dvd case . the ux5 's dvd case is maybe 1 / 4 " higher . so i found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller ux5 and it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found that the hc5 's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb . as i played with this in the store , i realized it seemed like the hc5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this . absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you . just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ) : i spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year 's avchd ux camcorders would still be present , and if i would care in any case . the detailed reviews still are n't out , so i do n't know whether there will be a noise problem there . but i can say i noticed nothing in the footage so far that i 'd call noise , so my decision to go with the tape and hdv format looks very good to me right now . i have never had the problems people report with mini-dv tapes , so that whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) did n't weigh on me much . the noise discussion did have an effect on my decision , though . getting the video to your tv : " how much money do we have ? " , apparently . i played the tape back to the tv directly , but that 's not a long-term solution . i have heard that you can capture the hdv video and then will be able to transform it on a pc to formats suitable for blu-ray or hdv burners , if you have the money . then you need a blu-ray or hdv player attached to your tv . for now , it sounds like many people are archiving the hdv video to dvds as data files . then they burn playable dvds where the hd is down-converted to standard definition video . so they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce hd versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied that hd files captured by ulead software could be moved to a ps3 hard drive and played back to an hd tv from there . so far , the easy and cheap path we have for sd video to dvds to tvs is not quite there for hd based on what i 've read . the one extra feature i wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20x optical zoom . i 'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively , so i " understand " . but that would be #1 on my wish list . overall , i am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now . i know we 're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago . but it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around , take some video , and then have play it back on a high-quality hd tv looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it 's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new tvs so beautifully .

with a good script and a director better suited to the material ( i 've read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct ) , asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson . unfortunately , the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms.. . a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession . the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist 's wife ( an excellent natasha richardson ) and one of the asylum 's patients ( an equally good marton csokas ) , under the watchful eye of the patient 's doctor ( ian mckellen ) . there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie , some of which seem quite preposterous , at least in the way the movie was shot . the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson . she does her best in spite of the choppy script , and she even won a best actress award in london for this film . however , as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession , director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job . ( in fact , i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson , credited as an executive producer , sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out .

this film had a powerful effect on me . 95% of the people i know do n't read books . i met a millionaire not long ago , who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his life . lady di was reported never to have read anything - - - except perhaps fashion mags . my children hardly read , and their husbands and wives certainly don't . my ex-wife never read anything . her father thought ulysses was a dirty book . i stopped watching television in 1980 , and i own 10 , 000 books - - - but not fahrenheit 451 , which i 'd read about 45 years ago . this was long enough for me not to compare the film with bradbury 's text , but the message came through the movie medium loud and clear , and with a very solid punch to the plexus . the manner in which it is written , played and directed , added to its impact . this world of sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us . the style was strange , but gradually you realise that this strangeness is actually what is now completely normal . people live and work like automated morons . they ca n't think for themselves , and their critical faculties are almost totally atrophied . they ca n't conduct a stimulating conversation of any kind : in fact , present them with an idea , or attempt to initiate a discussion , and they 'll often become angry . some of the several low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film depicts . ludicrous suggestions : remake it with mad mel gibson . have infantile spielberg direct it . bulk it out with computerised sfx . these ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of the sub-humans which the film targets , and many of them seem unable to understand their own language , let alone write it , or spell it . this is a memorable film , for those whose memories still function . unlike the captain of the firemen

the new nikon en-el3e battery is a slight update for the nikon en-el3 provided with earlier dslr models such as the d70. it adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery . the battery is grey to distinguish it from the black en-el3. the en-el3e is backwards compatible with the en-el3 : you can put it in your d70 or d50. the reverse is not true . the number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors , including shooting style , lcd usage , and of course , camera . ( the 2.5 " lcd on the d200 will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller d70. ) it is sufficient for a day of shooting . unless you are using a d200 in some professional capacity , in which case , you 'll probably be investing in at least one backup battery

this a " mystery-triller " starring tom berenger , gretta scacchi , corbin bernsen , joanne whalley-kilmer and bob hoskins , it 's the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive.she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically , crashing all the way.she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm , while he amazingly lives , at first leaving him in a coma , but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger.he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia.later , after being nursed back to health and " falling in love with his wife all over again , " he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man.obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth . it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller , but comes predictable fast.i knew the key ' mysteries ' almost immediately and i 'm sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law & order episodes will agree.eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments.i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again

the author had a great idea , but he cherry-picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense . for example , superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2. two jewish guys , right at the end of ww2 , write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b / c it 's destroyed.. . etc , etc. i 'm not critiscizing this book b / c it has a religious message . i 'm critiscizing it b / c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement . otherwise , i disagree with anybody that says it is " just a comic . " superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america

i have used both paperport 8 and paperport 9 deluxe for over a year so i am qualified to report . both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with windows xp pro . i cannot really get version 9 to operate . everytime i try its like cold molasses . click...wait....wait....wait...wait...and then lock up . i 'm very experienced . i 've been working with pcs since 1991. every other piece of software i 've loaded works very well...except for paperport 8 and 9. in theory paperport 9 should be fine because it converts all scans to pdf which is more or less a universal file format . however theory is a lot better than reality . support is nonexistent from scansoft . if you pay the $19.95 per incident , you still do not get a solution . the scansoft forum is always either not working ( another bad sign ) or it 's full of people complaining about the software and lack of support . unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives , but doqments looks promising . avoid paperport unless you have money and time to waste

this book does n't even deserve a star . i just fell upon it , on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house . i 'm nearly 17 years old , and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older , but honestly , i do n't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years.. . i 've read so many reviews raving about how ' poetic , sensual , wonderful ' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry i do n't see it ! anyone can write a bunch of sex stories . i did n't see anything poetic in the writing...it was plain . as for sensual and arousing ? hardly . it was crude , and vulgar . it was sex , sex , sex.. . and presented harshly , with none of the sensuality , the sweetness , the gentle pleasure one likes to associate with sex.. . it was boring , repetitive , and i 'll admit disturbing . what was the point of the story where the hungarian whatever forced himself on his adolescent children ? or the raped little boy ? it was just weird . there 's just the sex , and no development of any points she may be trying to make . it 's kind of just left there...unfinished.. . unsatisfying . frankly , it was so distasteful ( vulgar ) , i was shocked . and i 'm not religious , puritan , conservative or any such thing...quite the opposite , i have an open mind . but this book left me cold

that is what this film meant to me , looking at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by , so sweet , so unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is there . this film is a poem to paris and the passing of youth , with the hope of recapturing that one love , which when found engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind , always present , always remembered , always desired . the two lovers meet , seemingly a lifetime away from when they met by chance on a train , and with instant rapport they tell eachother in the space of a few hours everything that happened since they met 10 years earlier . they see how much they meant to eachother , how much they still could , like two pieces of a puzzle that fit . this is a genuinely beautiful film , more mature than the last one , much sadder and in many ways better and more realistic . it opened that sense of mystery that i have known , in life and its surprises and potential in the luck of finding true intimacy . julie delphy is one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages . she has become a sad person , stalled in relationships , though she is living up to her ideals . ethan hawke is struggling to grow with his success , in a down phase of his marriage and needing their friendship very badly . their relationship , so brief , rings totally true , in its humor , commitment , and occasional awkwardness . perhaps this is sentimental , but i think i have known love like this . it is an image more in my mind than the person perhaps , but our friendship is as deep as it was when we met nearly 35 years ago . some people simply pierce thru to the heart , earning a permanent place no matter who they later marry or what they become . it is an extraordinary sympathy for one another that is beyond sex ( well , maybe not too far beyond.. . ) . highest recommendation . this succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot in time , with an entire history implied behind it , like the greatest art . and i do think that the ending is ambiguous and must be interpreted , which is also so very much like real life

small town america.. . only this is n't the pleasant and white-picketed small town america of film noir fame , it 's the gray and colorless small town america of neo-noir , and there 's the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove it . a bum who 's being approached by that famous " man in a black trenchcoat " ... hard eight ( aka sydney , but i 've yet to see a version of it anywhere that actually claims that title ) is a debut pretty much as promising as blood simple to the brothers coen . paul thomas anderson immediately sets out to give us only the best , with actors he wants to make famous and a script that has characters doing almost nothing we want ( or expect ) them to do , but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout . anderson also uses neo-noir color to great effect , allowing red and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to do in classical noir . that said , anderson still knows where the majority of the talent lies , and despite the long takes and steady-cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long takes from later movies , he focuses most of his time on the characters ' faces , and just lets them be . if he had n't already done the amazing and always stunning later work of magnolia , boogie nights , and punch drunk love , i 'd say that this is a " promising debut that makes me impatient for the next anderson picture to come out , " but since he does now have four classics notched into his belt , i must say , " see this to see anderson at his roots , " and " man i ca n't wait for his next feature !

i recently purchased the anime studio 5 but not the pro version , which costs 150 more and gives more functionality . this is a fully functioning animation software , with lots of interesting features . i can see no reason that a novice animator such as i am would not be happy with this software . i would like to see more energy put into a manual , but you can scavenge the anime blog / chat site to find answers , or google other places . with a more robust manual , this would be 5 stars , not 4. it is really the reason i am reluctant to upgrade to pro , because i would want more lessons and tutorials to go along with the upgrade . if you have an interest in animating , this is the software for you .

i remember way back in ' 80 when this movie was the buzz of hollywood . that is , the buzz on johnny carson . the media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself . yet , in the mid 80 's , it came out on both betamax and vhs , and naturally i bought me a beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was . first , it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption . it is long and intraclly woven together . it is lavish and sometimes loud . it is a brutal slap in the face to " manifest destiny " and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is " god 's " country . as if their ' god " gave them wealth and privilige and that this god justifies revolution , massacre and war . many comparisons can be mase with the america of the late 19th century and the america ruled presently by king george w . and his robber barons of capitalism . but it is now , as then , much more conveniant to steer the " common man " into their churches , into their army , into their lies . the enemy is those " illegal aliens " those in the " gay agenda , " those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo . kris kristofferson plays a mayor / sherriff if wealth and means who ( shock-shock ) sides with the common man and the undertrodden . when another of his " breeding and class " challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class , he replies to the creep : " you are not of my class , to be of my class you first have to die and be born again ! " this is a revolutionary movie , meant to be savored , each and every minute of it . this movie dares you to look at things usually not into history books or shown on the history channel

they changed pretty much everything . for starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as file , tool , and edit . which means you ca n't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access . well maybe you can , but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of office ( and almost all other pc programs ) so much easier to use . you basically have to use the mouse for everything . and in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over-mousing . the ribbon is just awful . first of all it 's huge . it takes up about four times the space of my customized toolbar . they place nearly every button imaginable on it . and as far as i can tell you ca n't change it around or simplify it . every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not . which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck . you can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice . but in reality it turns what used to be simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations ( extend ribbon , spend several minutes searching for button , click button , retract ribbon ) . good grief ! what a pain . this software did n't last 24 hours on my system before i restored my old version of office . this new interface is about the most awful thing i 've ever seen on a computer . i know of certain free open source office suites that i prefer to this monstrosity . that being said i still prefer any and all previous versions of ms office to the free one . in fact i would rather be using my old wordperfect from 1995 than this *thing* that ms is trying to shove down our throats . if only i had n't thrown that disc away six years ago.. . before you " invest " your money in this software i strongly recommend you download the free trial version . then buy an earlier version

okay , take everything that you know about john squire . strip away the amazing stone roses first album , the not so amazing follow up , the nice brit pop of his work with the seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and i honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically . they would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful , the vocals might be grating at first ( think robert forster ( the go-betweens ) circa before hollywood ) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving . what you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception . people should listen to it for what it is and not for what john squire was...john squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do ( who has n't moved on in 13 years ? minus robert smith of course ! ) and now writes beautiful pop songs...john squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that

i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years . i was born & raised in the north . i think evans should rename his book " fiddler on the roof in the south " . his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here . it 's very much : the southern jews were all so happy , they all fit in and were accepted , etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us ' yankee jews ' , like the instances when a few ( yankee ) rabbis in the south fought for civil rights . evans should realize that times have really changed here ! the evangelical christians in my town ( which is most people here ) harrass me like crazy - ' i am praying for you ! ' ' have you read the words of jesus , who was a jew like you ? ' ' when will you come to my church' . blah , blah , blah . thank god for the minority of catholics , methodists , presbyterians and a few others who live here . they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am , and the way i will stay - a jew . i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience . jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences , and that they cannot relate to what i am saying . but i do want to ask evans a few questions : 1 ) if things are so great for the jews in the south : why have you lived in new york for decades now ? ? ? 2 ) why do n't you at least write either a new forward to the book , a magazine article , etc. , contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time ( for some of us at least ) , primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians ? i read evans ' books before i moved here , and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here . for a jew who really cares about her / his religion living here is depressing ; it is practically jew-less ; and , at best , the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me . ( by the way , i am planning to move to a city ! ) by the way , do n't bother writing to me to tell me that i am " wrong " , or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church . believe me , with all the praying for me that is going on in this town , and all the myriad attempts to convert me , if it has n't happened by now , as they say in these parts , it just ai n't gonna happen

this just to voice my opinion on the new ran transfer . while i agree it is an improvement over the atrocious fox lorber edition ( which is not that great an achievement considering the fox lorber dvd was one of the worst products in the history of home entertainment ) , this tranfer is still a long way from doing this masterpiece justice . yes , the colors are vivid but the sharpness and definition are exceptionally poor and the heavy edge enhancement ( straight from hell ! ) does n't make it any better . i have seen transfers of movies that are some 30 or 40 years older than ran but look far better . the problem becomes very obvious when one watches this dvd via progressive component output on a large screen - a video tape was used as a master ( and a poor one at that ) . the only way to restore such an important movie properly and thereby finally showing mr. kurosawa the respect he deserves would have been to make a direct digital transfer off an original film negative , before applying filters or any enhancements . why this opportunity was ( again ) wasted here escapes me totally and angers me very much . another problem seems to be the excessive use of noise reduction on the video , which is in part responsible for the poor definition of the transfer . for my part , i would much sooner live with a bit of visible film grain and the odd dust speckle than to have a such a " saucy " soft picture without much " bite " and detail . there is no excuse for posting such an objectively false statement . and yes , the packaging is a liability - my dvds must have been bobbing about in there all the way across the atlantic and looked accordingly . shocking . i would have gladly payed twice the price if they had kept all the cards and posters and instead got the most important thing right : the image quality of ran . like this , i 'm very disappointed

this is a really nice compact camera from canon . the picture quality is excellent . i have tried some night / day shots and the pictures are great . the zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for . the build quality is excellent and i really love the 3 " display . i find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it . the camera is very compact but i never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand . the images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp . i would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original canon battery and its available on amazon . the accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original canon parts especially the extra battery . also get a sd card with large enough memory . what comes with the camera ( 32mb ) is really a waste . still do n't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card . but overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results

stiff upper lip is a good ac / dc album , it 's not a great ac / dc album . it kills me when people say that ac / dc have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have done . nothing could be further from the truth . i have always thought that each ac / dc album has a sound and a feel and a story in it 's own and that a track off each album would be totally out of place on another album . for instance , can you image shake a leg on stiff upper lip ? or ballbreaker on back in black ? it does n't work . stiff upper lip has its own kind of rough , bluesy feel to it . brian 's voice sounds different , the tones and the guitars sound different . it 's good but not great . the standouts.. . 1. stiff upper lip - pretty rocking song . has a good attitude . it 's fun . 2. hold me back and ca n't stand still . very odd rolling songs . they sound a lot alike . again , these songs could never have been on back in black . i have heard that brian sang ca n't stand still in one take , that 's why they all clap at the end . i do n't know if that 's true , but it 's an interesting song . 3. satellite blues - this one is an instant classic . i love this song . this song could have been done back in the days of back in black and if it were on that album i think it would be as popular as you shook me all night long . everything else is ho hum . not good , not bad . better than most bands out there . i am really hoping ac / dc put out a killer album with their new release , whenever that is . i hope they do n't turn into the new g&r and suffer from the chinese democracy syndrome

what is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book - - which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel - - is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24. nope , the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced " the great gatsby " a mere five years later . " this side of paradise " is a mess : it is as uneven , affected , feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero , the tiresomely self-conscious young minnesotan-gone-to-princeton amory blaine . ( one suspects , in fact , that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory 's diary the result would have been considerably more readable - - or the book 's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable , at least . ) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 - - it was to prove the most popular book , in terms of sales , ever produced by its author - - presumably speaks to the public 's recognition of something new and revealing in it . okay , amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype ; and the drinking and shameless smooching ( etc. ) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably , one can accept , a revelation to see in print ( and likely a titillating one ) for an american audience raised on mcguffy 's readers - - and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war . welp , here it comes : " on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon , the ` petting party . ' none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed . " to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is , of course , very small beer . what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now , in the best cases of the paradise narrative , as unalarming quaintness . while this is not exactly fitzgerald 's " fault " , so to speak , it is also true that the use of " shocking revelations " of this type - - scandals specific to a place and time - - represents a risk a writer takes : the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and / or universal in such episodes . in any event , the price the reader pays here , in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory 's adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties , is very , very high for payoffs of such modest proportions . i mean , come on : " for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart . the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds , he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore ; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it . eleanor was , say , the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty , the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes . " yikes . i do n't care what new generation you 're talking about , can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody ? ( can it represent anything to anybody ? ) there are things to like , even admire , here and there in paradise . fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark ( e.g. , " they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered . " " sometimes i wish i 'd been an englishman ; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy . " " it 's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes ; they do it so much better . " ) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator 's observations is , in its now-curious way , refreshingly , bracingly funny : " slowly and inevitably , yet with a sudden surge at the last , while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht] , war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played . every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings . when amory went to washington the next weekend , he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back , for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks , he guessed , or russians . " nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there 's a war on , i always say . anyway , most of the novel consists of young amory 's elaborate ponderings - - romantic , philosophical and egotistical - - which are as forgivable as they are forgettable . i 've forgotten them already . at some level , in any case , fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character - - who was , of course , a not-very-disguised version of himself . for how else , if not as commendably self-deprecating irony , are we to take this observation ? " amory was in full stride , confident , nervous , and jubilant . scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do , so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him , and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours . " in the end , in any event , one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs. fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder . in paradise almost nothing works : form , content , narrative stance , dialogue , character development , pacing - - you name it , it 's a problem . yet in gatsby , five years later , everything works - - everything . if there is to be a great american novel , it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor . while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b , the fact is that he did - - and without point a the journey could not have begun . so while " this side of paradise " hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon , it surely deserves our respect , and indeed our gratitude , for what it led to .

i respect the message of " the unexpected legacy of divorce " but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce " unexpected . " those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result . staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times . the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit . i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time . they fell apart due to abuse , infidelity , and just plain incompatibility . what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents . when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids , most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house . when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority , who constantly disappoints , hurts , and replaces the kids , there will be damage , no getting away from it . however , is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids , seemingly with the other parent 's approval ? i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion . it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married . this is a major flaw in the research . i did n't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference . i do n't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens , you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears . when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid 's , whether it 's divorce or starting a new life afterward , kids will suffer . i do n't like ' studies ' like this , they 're misleading and potentially damaging .

try to name some of the greatest debut rock albums . let me give you one ground rule though : it has to be from a band that put out at least five albums ( so no stone roses , sugar , verve or jane 's addiction , e.g. ) . here are some of mine , off the top of my head : led zeppelin i , in the court of the crimson king , days of future passed , the doors , boy ( u2 ) , c.s.n. , ca n't buy a thrill ( steely dan ) , ten ( pearl jam ) , murmur ( rem ) . i 'm sure there are a number of others that i 'm forgetting . oh yeah , one more : the incredible " ferment , " by catherine wheel . the harmonies and swirling lush guitar sounds created by rob dickinson and brian futter , the compelling rhythms generated by dave hawes ( bass ) and neil sims ( percussion ) , it just all works , and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary " nowhere " by ride ( not quite as great as " loveless " by my bloody valentine ) . unfortunately , c.w. never quite matched the power of " ferment " with their subsequent releases . the best song on the album is " black metallic " ( " it 's the color of her skin / her skin is black metallic " ) which soars up to the sky , floats in the wind , lands , and soars again . clearly , " black metallic " clocks in as the band 's " stairway to heaven . " the second best song on " ferment " is . . . well that 's where it gets tricky , and demostrates how great this album is . there are no weak or even average songs , and i could see where anyone of the others can be considered as a runner up to " black metallic . " put a gun to my head and i would have to go with " shallow " or maybe " tumbledown " or perhaps , if i 'm in a more pop oriented mood , the danceable " i want to touch you . " although , last night , as i was listening to the album in preparation for this review , i thought of how strongly it closes with the trio " " bill and ben , " " salt " and the uplifting " balloon " ( " ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon " ) . a wonderful album . perhaps not in my top ten , but definitely in my top twenty ( tied with the aforementioned " nowhere " )

from a pure image quality standpoint , this lens will not please the pixel peepers . on the wide end of the zoom , which i personally use more often than the telephoto end , this lens is not very sharp , and it suffers from fairly bad distortion . worse than that , for me , are the chromatic abberations ; this lens is quite prone to significant ca when shot at the wide end , which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness . given the price of this lens , one should expect a higher level of optical performance . the maximum aperture of this lens is not very large , being f / 4 on the wide end , and f / 5.6 on the telephoto end . the image stabilization makes up for this some , as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let 's be honest here ; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod . the small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder , which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark ( using a tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , and this is not without reason . first of all , the focal length range is quite handy . it is n't a mega-zoom that does everything , however , it covers the most often used focal length ranges , and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations . the little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion , and it 's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end , but zoomed in , it 's quite good . i have printed as large as 20x30 " using this lens on a digital rebel , and have no qualms with the results . yes , there are sharper lenses out there , but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print . this lens has ring usm , which enables it to focus very quietly , and very quickly , whereas the slightly cheaper ( and f2.8 ) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison . if you want to use this lens indoors , you are best off getting a flash to go with it , such as a 430ex . the lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting , or during the day , but wo n't give you good results in low light with no flash . if you will be shooting in lower light situations ( people in particular ) , tamron and sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with f2.8 apertures , and i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you 'd prefer the extra telephoto range , the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field ( instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f / 4 , for instance , without image stabilization , you could use f / 11 on this lens , and get a sharp picture with better depth of field . this is even more useful in the close focus range - while this is n't a true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without a tripod , you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field , and the is helps with that quite a bit . overall , i 've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens . if you like to worry about splitting hairs , and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer , this lens is likely to dissapoint you . if , however , you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded , useful lens , then i 'd recommend it , however , would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options , as they are also great lenses , and do offer a somewhat better value

i 've seen and heard sheryl live when she 's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs . she 's great - she 's hip , self-assured and kicks butt ! but here , she tells the audience in " leaving las vegas " : " i 'm playing central park tonight.. . but i have some friends coming up so can you be patient...please ? for lil ' ol ' me ? be very patient... . " almost begging the audience not to walk out while she 's singing solo . it 's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the " friends " arrive . the irony is that sheryl solo is the best part of the album . with the others on board , we ca n't see what sheryl can do , and those familiar with her know that sheryl is capable of a lot . she 's overwhelmed by keith richard , stevie nicks , eric clapton , chrissie hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature . her songs " it do n't hurt " and " there goes the neighborhood " stand out on the album showing that sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her " friends . " too bad she did n't include " am i getting through " - - the part 2 of that was a great rock moment . natalie maines ' grating voice ( like fingernails on a chalkboard ) completely ruin " strong enough . " chrissie sounds like a zombie on " if it makes you happy " , sarah mclaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her lilith-fair mode that she adds nothing to " a difficult kind " ...in fact , by the end of the song sarah seems to disappear from the song as sheryl belts it to the end . that 's sheryl 's song and should remain so , tombstone blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of " all i wanna do " is the new york audience . happy , white room and gold dust woman are three classic rock standards , so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70 's fm aor radio has heard them ad nauseaum . problem here is that nothing new is added to them , they sound like karaoke versions . despite sheryl 's plea for patience , i was bored with the old-timers.they did n't bring sheryl 's career forward , only backwards

i 've been using this since the first beta release , and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles . the ribbon interface is more upfront with the commands most ofter used , and my old keystroke commands are still there as well . after changing my default save setting to 97-2003 i have run into no compatibility problems . as with most of the bad reviews on ms products , it seems people are quick to rush with a bad review when they are unable to find or do something as quickly as they have in the past . my advice is to spend ten minutes looking through all of the menus.. . they make sense , and once you get used to it , you 'll never want to go back to the old way again . everything is cleaner , smoother , faster , and easier to use than ever before , and i have been using office for longer than i care to admit . let go of the past people ! this is the future of business productivity

i like this camera . some settings take it beyond the standard point and shoot experience . for a first-timer , it has been great . the camera rates 4 stars . customer service , on the other hand , has been a disaster . an easy share software downloaded update did n't load properly and led me on a trail of three customer service reps over the course of 4 1 / 2 hours with no resolution . after requesting to speak to a customer service manager , i was promised that a $7.95 cd of the software would be sent for free ( though it was clear he was doing me a favor because " these cd 's cost money and do n't grow on trees , " he said . whether or not the cd solves the problem remains to be seen . but customer service is awful . to recap : nice camera , but unless you have endless customer service patience , search out other options

the bloodshot gang knows how to have a good time ! if you 're into the whole alt.country thing , you know that some of it is very sincere and serious ( ie , uncle tupelo , jayhawks ) . now i love " no depression , " and " blue earth , " but this is an altogether different quadrant of alternative country known as militant honky tonk , or just insurgent country . truth be told , this incredible anniversary compilation does have some poignant , serious numbers ( rico bell 's " money to burn , " the texas rubies ' " blue diamond mine , " mike ireland 's " i 'd like to " ) , but for the most part these maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously . you 've got andre williams and sally timms singing " i 'll stick to you like glue.. . " , in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going " g-l-e-u , glue ! " you 've got a song with a man and a woman serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss each other 's bodies . you 've got kim docter and moonshine willy belting out " turn the lights down low , " which really ought to be a hit it 's so catchy . and you 've got some great deadpan covers - - the waco brothers do a country rave-up of the who 's baba o'riley , " red star belgrade does it to ac / dc 's " highway to hell , " and best of all , the unholy trio turns public enemy 's " bring the noise " into an understated redneck anthem . i 'm only scratching the surface here , with 40 tracks over 2 discs . this is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on.. . and do n't miss the fantastic earlier bloodshot compilation , hell-bent ( insurgent country , volume ii ) - - see my 9 / 5 / 04 review

this is a great pda bible for many reasons , several of which are already mentioned in other reviews . it is easy to use , has most of the niv study bible notes and crossreferences , comes with a multi color highlighter ( great for using different colors for different purposes...red for commands , blue for promises , etc. ) , you can change the font for easier reading , and it has a great search engine in case you want all of the references to , say " peace " that occured in the new testament . the programs that come with it are nice as well , including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the bible in one year , the ot in one year , the nt in one year , and many more options . i was somewhat disappointed by a few features that would have made it a hands-down 5 star program , though . the original niv study bible has elaborate introductions for each book , including author , purpose , structure , and much more . the palm version is lacking all of this , and has no introduction at all . the original also has many cultural information boxes all throughout the bible , like a description of the differences between pharasees and sauducees ; the palm version does not . the cross references are wonderful - click on a small circle after a verse , and all of the cross references pop up . simply click on a cross reference , and the program takes you right there . unfortunately , however , the palm program has no feature like a " back " button that gets you back to the original text . finding your original spot is not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds and a little concentration - but would have been much nicer to go instantly back the same way you can instantly get to a cross refernce by clicking on it . finally , i would be actively marketing this product and the palm platform to all of my friends if it included all of the wonderful maps that the original has - maps of the holyland , jerusalem , the middle east , the temple , and others that are in my paper niv study bible . despite these flaws , however , the program is a joy to use and i highly recommend it to all . i am using a tungsten t3 - the larger screen size make reading easier

the manchurian candidate is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring frank sinatra . this film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone . this is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies . afraid to assert a viewpoint , the script meanders . denzel washington plays the sinatra role of ben markoe . he seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines . washington , normally a gifted actor , plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role . markoe discovers that his gulf war comrade-in-arms , raymond shaw , soon to be the next vice-president of the united states , has been the subject of mind control experimentation by manchurian global , a vast multinational conglomerate . raymond 's handler is his senator mother ( meryl streep in the role of an ice queen ) . by diluting the threat from communism to capitalism , the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story . after all , it is no great achievement to convince a major american political candidate to back big business , and so the grotesqueries of shaw 's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop , seeming less heinous than merely greedy , even when shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious , amoral , and possibly incestuous mother . why the film created the unlikely manchurian global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the manchurian global mindset that has gripped hollywood . god forbid we should point a finger at mainland china ( or anyplace else ) ; it might reduce the bottom line . this film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray . do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original .

reading through john irving 's " the cider house rules , " i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity . in obtaining a bachelor 's degree in english , i had to read a lot of books . among them were many books that i did not like , but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety . every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along . people become pregnant , have abortions , and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens . this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing . the book does n't flow naturally , you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows , playing the puppet master . there are just so many coincidences , so many old friends just happening to run into eachother , so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly , all of the characters vaguely , distantly connected to eachother . i do n't want to spoil the plot , but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames ( rhymes with screams ) family is just too much coincidence to bear . it 's as though the author is god , and the characters completely lack free will . and then there 's the " protagonist , " homer wells . i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story , homer wells barely does anything in the story . he barely even speaks during the story . he is virtually a non-character , devoid of personality or will , around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve . the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all , and they make up the majority of the book , are without fail the most interesting scenes . i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr. larch , but even melony seems more real than homer does . the story is very long and rambling . subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on . minor characters keep popping into the story , then disappearing , only to pop back into the story exactly when they 're needed . conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten ( like the situation with debra pettigrew ) . after such a rambling , at times rather boring plot , the ending feels rather rushed . it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything , tie up every loose end , in the last 25 pages ( and tying up loose ends , in this case , means a lot of people conveniently dying ) . to spoil the plot just a little , homer wells , who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul , suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion . i personally am pro-choice as well , but i found that homer 's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters

i did a lot of research before buying this camera . we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price . what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm dvd-r , finalize the disc on the camcorder , and play it directly on our dvd player or dvd-rom player on our computer . we did n't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv , electrical outlet , and camera to playback footage . and we also did n't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future . for those of you who like to edit , re-record , create effects , etc. , you need to purchase special software separately , but with a dvd-ram disc , you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvd-rom on your computer . you can also download it with the usb cable , but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started . if you are only interested in playback , dvd-r discs are sufficient ; however , you ca n't erase or record over footage on dvd-rs , only dvd-rw and dvd-ram discs . the picture quality of the camera is adequate . it is n't grainy , but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting , especially outside on a sunny day . it does n't have a built-in light , so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording . i would give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5. if you want better quality , you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder . considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology , it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy . you ca n't compare it to tv and movie camera quality , but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos . the zoom is good , but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly . the stabilizer is pretty good , but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality . if you plan to move around a lot , use the function , but expect to lose a little quality in the process . what basically happens when using the stabilizer ( with most cameras , i believe ) is that the image movements are slightly delayed . the sound quality is adequate , but if you are recording when it is windy , you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand . the only problem i have had so far is with the discs . we bought panasonic dvd-rw discs and ca n't get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player . we ended up purchasing sony dvd-r discs and they play with no problem . when i called panasonic about their dvd-rw discs , they did n't have a good answer . the representative told me to make sure the dvd-rw discs are compatible with my players . i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player , but it should be with my new computer software . the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there is n't any difference between sony and panasonic discs ( interesting ) . they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual , but now i know better . overall , this camcorder is a great value ( you ca n't beat the price for this dvd technology ) , average to good quality picture and functions , is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage , and is really easy to use .

i purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers . we are all on our feet all day long . after one other coworker told us about the one he had , we all had to have one to help our tired feet . everyone of us is very happy with this product . it is a great value for the price . there are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super . we did have a problem with one , but amazon quickly exchanged it for us . i think it was defective from the factory . great product and even better service from amazon

several years ago i used delorme 's street atlas with a usb gps receiver . the software worked but the interface was lousy . this year i tried microsoft 's streets and trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the delorme software , but still surprisingly clumsy . and the help is possibly the worst i have seen in a microsoft product ( that 's saying a lot ) . here are some of the problems : 1. street & trips is expecting a gps receiver that uses a **com port**. are you kidding me ? in 2007 ? ? ? the delorme earthmate 20 ( usb ) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software , but why is this necessary ? ? ? ( and it was not trivial to get it to work . ) 2. the handling of pushpins ( identifying spots on the map ) , favorite places , and the like , is extremely clumsy . ( although , contrary to another review , you do n't to re-enter the information each time . you just save the file and reload it . ) 3. directions are sometimes not so great . why would you instruct someone to " turn left " if you do n't know which direction they 're pointing ( e.g. , when you 're stationary in a parking lot ) ? much better in such cases to say " head ne " or some such . freeway exits ( at least in so . california ) were often not handled well . ( one freeway entrance was identified as a " local road " , which at the time proved quite confusing . ) 4. why does n't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you " on-route " once you 're off-route ? you can push f3 , but why is this necessary ? 5. i never got the voice providing driving guidance to work . the online help was useless . i 'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it , but it should be trivial . 6. in general , the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together . i 'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot ( i bought this software after all ) , but i find that much ms software is bad precisely because it feels like it 's cobbled together without much attention given to integration . it 's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it . given this experience , i will probably give the delorme software another try next time around .

i will be utterly honest , i do n't buy music cds anymore . with so many bands hitting the streets faster than i can imagine , i honestly cannot keep up with them all . music begins to sound the same , corporations seem to have their pre-determined hit prior to the public even forming their own opinion . those like the simpsons , backstreet boys , and even hip-hop artists are blending together to sound uniform , unoriginal , and overly drab . i had nearly lost my faith in music , retreating to some of my older music like dmb , counting crows , and travis , but then i found ... the suns . stumbling around the internet i discovered , shockingly , one of the videos to their album called " romantic death " . it was one of the most creative and disturbing videos that i have seen in quite some time . then it hit me , i could n't get this song out of my mind . throughout the whole day i had the beat , the lyrics , and the overall sensation of the song stuck in my mind ... and i had only heard it once . like a drug , i needed more . when i returned home that evening i found the song again and could n't stop listening to it . for the first time in a long time , i had found a new band . then , i bought this album . knowing nothing about the band except for the " romantic death " song , i put this in my dvd player and continued to be impressed . their videos are just as smart as their music . their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from folk , rock , and even hard edge . their lyrics seem well-considered , smart and a voice to a new generation . my favorites of the album are : " must be you " " romantic death " ( parental guidance is suggested ) " lost at home " " rockstop " " we tried " in fact , every time i listen to this album i find a new song to explore , a new song to jam to on the way to work ; a new song to enjoy ! for those skeptical of this band , i suggest this album to test your tastes . not only does it provide songs for you to burn onto other cds which allow friends and family to explore this band , but also all of their energetic , original videos that will never see the light of day on mtv , but can be watched from the leisure of your dvd player . the sun are a breath of fresh air to the music industry and this album finally got me out of the corporate rut that seems to be plaguing this industry . " ...if the rockstops , it 'll be all my fault.. . " grade : ***** out of *****

as a young woman i was appauled by gurian 's lack of respect for women as human beings.what makes me the most furious is his shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the boys and men to take the lead in life.the resounding message is girls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because of our hormones make important contributions to society beyond traditional roles.i do n't remember ever being taken over by hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative chemical reactions he believes all females to be . i agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.gurian is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his books being mindfull of his tricks.his book is full of agenda .

" the other boleyn girl " and " the queen 's fool " are two of the best books i 've ever read- -and i 've read a lot of books , especially about this period , which especially fascinates me . they were gripping to the end , and my involvement with the characters was complete- -true masterpieces . so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out , i buy it , hoping to have the same experience , and lately have been sorely disappointed . " the virgin 's lover " fell flat , and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged , must give it up . one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly- -that is always an easy guess , however it depends on the writer . anthony trollope , for instance , was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed . that may or may not be the case with gregory . i know , as a writer myself , that there are times when the work flows out , feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source , and times when it 's harder , more mechanical . the more challenging situations are those when i 'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject . so to me , neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse . they feel forced , constructed . i 'm going back to trollope

i picked this book up at my public library because i had put it on my reading list a while back when i saw that the president ( ! ) of the united states george bush read it while he was on vacation too . i went to my local cofee place and got a medium regular cofee flavored cofee but in a large cup ( so theres room for plenty of milk which i like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large ) . anyway i am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where i have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there . so then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning . and he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing . anyway then he leaves and i notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as i thought previously . so i 'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so i take it back to the library . now here i have to point out that i had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that i returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight . well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever i go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when i turn the book in . i explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me . but you can guess how this ended up . i am down another $8 dollars and change ( i paid the .50 cents in pennies i got from the place i keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since i counted them out one by one but it was worth it ) . and i never finished the book since it was ruined . but ! i liked the parts i read " okay " and if the president likes it i guess it gets four stars only i made it two stars because i only read half . maybe i will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then i will come back and give this book it 's missing two stars if it ends well . lesson learned is life is not always fair but you " keep on keepin on " like they say

" doctor livingstone i presume ? " is undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history . very few people , however , are familiar with the history underlying the meeting of dr. david livingstone and henry morton stanley . this book details the lives of the two men and the historical background through which they were thrown together . livingstone , one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the source of the nile river . through a combination of bad luck , poor planning , disease , weather , natives , etc. , livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of lake tangyanika . henry stanley , a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher . this book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place . the perils of african exploration in the late 19th century cannot be overstated . this book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader . i found this book very similar in style and experience to undaunted courage ( which detailed the voyage of discovery undertaken by lewis and clark ) and river of doubt ( dealing with theodore roosevelt 's exploration of the amazon basin . if you enjoyed either of these books , you will like this one as well . if you read this book and enjoy it , i highly recommend the other two

we had this camera for about a year until on thanksgiving day while out of town it broke . the lense just froze while in the middle of taking a picture and wouldnt ever go back into the camera . we ran out to best buy and purchased it again because it was just a simple to use basic camera for me and my dad . ( 2 years later the old cameras lense still wont go back into the camera yet the camera still will turn on..weird . ) at first we liked the camera and it took good pictures . they look great when we got them developed ( costco.com is the best place to upload them and 1 hour later you pick them up , super cheap too ) and the quality was good . within the last year the camera has turned into a piece of crap . evvvvvery picture comes out blurry it seems . inside or outside . i am constantly telling people who take pics for me to take 2 or 3 pictures because i know one or two will be blurry and that is a great shot i will miss because of it . also the flash quality is horrible . it takes okay pictures of people in the dark but if it 's of an object ( anything really , just not a person ) it comes out pitch black . inside the lighting is bad too . the camera can never focus and it 's just annoying . i also went through 2 or 3 memory sticks made by sony that for no reason just broke . one of them broke while in a store getting them developed ( in the little machine ) and erased all of my pictures which was very dissapointing . the people said there was no way it was their machine , that it had to be a default in the memory stick . also the camera is pretty big and clunky . at the time it was actually a smaller camera on the market , now it is huge ! i am looking into now buying the canon powershot 6.

i really really really really like allison moorer . have been a fan since her first record , have road-tripped to see her numerous times , and love her songwriting and singing . that said - - " getting somewhere " is by far the least satisfying of her records . no memorable songs . over-produced . no " guts " , as another reviewer said . when the allison moorer / doyle " butch " primm songwriting team called it quits ( in more ways than one ) , their lennon / mccartney-caliber teamwork was lost . not that moorer sounds like the beatles , but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music . this cd is not only unmemorable but i doubt i would care to ever listen to it again . such a shame . i 've never had anything negative to say about allison in the 8 years i 've been a fan . but this cd left me cold . it hurts a bit to say this , but i cannot recommend this cd . the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the b-story line from an episode of " the larry sanders show " . in that episode , sanders ' head writer phil ( played by wallace langham ) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy . as a result he lost his edge . when he was a miserable person he was an edgy , cynical , funny jokewriter . when he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job . same with moorer . since her recent changes in her social life she has started " singing a sweeter tune " in her life , but it came with a cost . she does n't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that " other " songwriter who was so good - - a little edgy , sad , sometimes bitter , or at least that 's how i interpreted it . granted , that was n't her entire oeuvre , but it is what made her songs special for me . now she 's happy and she might as well be writing songs for barney the dinosaur

in his recently published history , the whiskey rebellion , william hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania . what hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of howard zinn . he has an axe to grind , and by the end alexander hamilton is the devil incarnate , and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the american revolution to its necessary conclusion . the accusation that hogeland comes back to again and again is that hamilton incited the rebellion . the argument is that because hamilton 's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen 's resistance , and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion . the problem with hogeland 's argument is his scholarship , or lack there of . he almost never offers a direct quote , especially when accusing hamilton of malfeasance . instead , hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote . the reader is expected to accept on faith the author 's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end . not all of this is hogeland 's fault . the new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting , opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop . even doris kearns goodwin , a legitimate scholar , is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze . ultimately , this is the main problem with william hogeland : he is not a scholar . he is a magazine writer with an agenda , and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions . to read some radical agenda into the actions of the pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history , because there is no basis in reality .

with the $70-million that was spent on the 2005 video-game-inspired film " doom " , you 'd think that director andrzej bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly . on second thought , given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of " shoot the mutants " , it 's pretty clear that mr. bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment . as to the film 's plot , it can be summarized in a single sentence : a group of ï¿½ber-soldiers lead by their " sarge " ( played by the rock ) travel to mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with dna recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a martian archaeological dig . so , there 's tons of shooting , a lot of screams , gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about , a martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of " the sphere " . others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include karl urban ( ï¿½ber-soldier john grimm ) and rosamund pike ( as john grimm 's sister named sam ) . why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in " doom " defies logic . to anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1-star film in a theater , you have my deepest sympathy . to anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of " doom " on dvd , please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price . that alone should tell you how " good " this film is

the cutting edge is one of those break out feel good movies you can watch anytime and it 's still as much fun today as the first time i saw it in 1992. " doug dorsey " played with verve by d.b. sweeney , is a rising hockey star with a bright future ahead him until a freak accident on the ice shatters his chances of playing at the peak of the competitive level . it 's not long before doug is noticed by skating coach " anton pamchenko " roy dotrice , an affable personality whom the audience gravitates to from the start . pamchenko brings mr.dorsey to the estate of kate moseley , moira kelly , a would-have been gold medalist at the 1984 winter games in sarajevo . she blamed her former partner for their loss and never fully recovered , you see . kate has an acerbic tongue that 's as sharp as her blades . she has issues welcoming a new partner and doug is no exeception . the two meet and a hostile alliance is soon formed as they begin practice sessions . doug is n't used to figure skates and kate takes full advantage of this by " missing " serveral connections in the routines which cause him to painfully contact the ice . each time he falls , kate skates by teasing him uttering " toe pick . " one of my favorite scenes in the movie . doug is made of quite stern stuff and soon turns the tables on kate in a harmless way during an impromtu " hockey game " played on her private indoor rink . having ironed out the roughness , the two become quite polished and a budding romance ensues between them . the question is , do they have what it takes to become 1988 olympic champions in pairs figure skating ? the acting is charming and the soundtrack first rate.i would have given it five stars except for the ending , which i wo n't give away here . buy the dvd & cd , you wo n't be dissappointed

this is one of the best camcorders in the market today and i would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to buy a mini-dv camcorder positive factors : - very small and easy to hold with one hand . can be easily attached even to a mini-tripod with ease . - excellent widescreen video and hi-fi audio . your videos finally get that " hollywood " feel when you shoot movies in 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) . even if you do n't have a widescreen tv currently , you will very soon have one as more and more people are buying them . so its better to buy this camcorder and shoot in 16:9 format to enjoy your movies later in widescreen format . - includes widescreen rotatable lcd so what you see is what you get when you shoot in 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) - good battery life . one extra battery is enough . you can easily manage a day 's worth of shooting with two batteries before recharging them again - includes docking station making it easier to connect to computer or tv . if you have a good computer with a firewire port , please buy a firewire cable to connect the camcorder to your computer . you can download your movie in excellent clarity in .avi format and edit it as required - make sure to change the audio setting to 16 bit ( instead of the default 12 bit ) for very good hi-fi audio - touchscreen menu system is great . you do n't have to search for any buttons as they are all available in the touchscreen menu itself . - 10x optical zoom is more than sufficient for ordinary home videos . anything more produces more " shaking " and would necessiate the use of a tripod . when you shoot without a tripod , 10x is the best zoom you can achieve without worrying about shaky videos - widescreen still photo . the photo clarity is ok not too good . so please do n't expect great shots . since the photo is in 16:9 format , you can take panoramic photos and cover more people in group shots - nightshot : cool feature that records using infrared light . useful for shooting at night as you can record a video even in 100% darkness - color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you are running down on batteries and need to use the viewfinder . the color widescreen viewfinder gives an excellent picture and is as good as the lcd in clarity negative factors : - outdoor videos especially in bright sunlight are overexposed . so please adjust the white balance when shooting outdoors . add the white-balance menu to your shortcuts so that you can easily access it and return to default once you start shooting indoors - sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks ( best to turn off the button click " beep " sound ) . notes : - use a fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times on the same cassette . the head tends to get dirty if you re-record on the same cassette more than 3 times - you can edit movies in windowx xp using windows movie maker , but beware it does not support 16:9 ratio video . hence your videos look ugly as you shot them in 16:9 but movie maker converted it to 4:3. invest in pinnacle software version 9 or 10 for better movie editing capabilities . pinnacle is the only software , i am aware of , that preserves teh 16:9 ratio . even roxio could not allow 16:9 format . - you can also invest in wide-angle lens as it gives excellent coverage

we love this camcorder ! we bought it because our other bulky , digital video that uses tapes , which we would have to copy onto vhs / dvd , stopped working . we did n't want to spend a lot of money . we loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it ( which is very simple to do , and you do not have to download any software . ) i have to admit i was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great , and only 60 minutes concerned me , but the pictures is great and i have n't ran out of time yet . we have used this indoors , outdoors and have no problems . we have recorded our son 's basketball games and it worked great . we read where the batteries did n't last very long , but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have . this is a must for those who have children or grandchildren

david bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial . this is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial . a disco-esque record , it 's remembered more fondly than it was received by bowie fans at the time . it has some good moments , but overall the production is just too slick and there 's a dearth of imagination on it - china girl is an old iggy pop song , cat people is just a newer version of a previous single and criminal world is a cover of a song by metro , meaning there 's a grand total of five new songs on it . china girl proves a perfect foil for bowie 's melodramatic vocals , cat people is still great even when smothered in too much production and modern love proves that you 're ( nearly ) always gonna get at least one classic on a bowie album . ironically , while it made him a global megastar , this record also marked the start of bowie 's alarmingly swift fall from grace . if he 'd stuck to the highly original work he 'd churned out before this , he 'd probably have had his moment in the sun anyway.. . and nobody could have accused him of selling out . now , what 's that they say about hindsight

i bought this camera in the beginning of january . i was looking for a compact camera ( not necessarily pocket size , though ) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality . based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd . i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive , which is true . after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions , with and without flash , bright light , low light , different iso settings , different exposure times , etc. i compared the pictures with my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 and the results were amazing . the picture quality of the fuji was very poor . colors were ' smeared ' but the main problem was noise . even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise , same with other colors ( rgb noise ) . i did n't check grey / black noise ( as they do in the test reports ) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying . what a disappointment . the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well , at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc-v1 with a carl zeiss lens . after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5. this is really a great camera , i must admit . the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good . i can only recommend sony 's h5 , even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd . what i liked about the f31fd was its size , its responsiveness and the monitor and menu . however , if the picture quality is so poor it also does n't really help

i 've always preferred wordperfect to word . i find it is easier to use , more intuitive , and allows more control over documents . it is less buggy , and i have yet to find one thing that word does better than wp . this new version of wp is even better than the old , and i can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from word . word users should find this version especially easy to switch to , since it can be made to look and act like word ( though why anyone would want that , i do n't know ) . underneath the surface , though , it is still wp , which means it is stable , you can see codes in your document and manipulate them , and it wo n't do things like decide when you put a number somewhere that you are making a list and start indenting and doing other weird things you do n't want and ca n't control . i have been using wpx3 heavily since i got it , but i still have n't used all the features . i am especially looking forward to trying its pdf conversion function . i also have n't used any of the other programs in the suite yet , but if prior versions are any indicator , they will also be easy to use and powerful .

i recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my digital rebel xl . my worries were needless : just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that i have . when attached to my eos elan 7n film camera , however , the lens really truly comes into its own , as the full frame 35mm slr delivers the entire focal range of this lens . the focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-l grade lens . and i agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it , like the l lenses have . this glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses , and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money . solidly built too , with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it . i highly recommend it

" you get what you pay for " most of the time that cliche is true , but there are products out there that break this rule . the philips dvp642 is one of them , a great quality , versatile product selling at a bargain price . this is not . i was hoping the same of this product from all the " glowing " reviews on here . however , this quality of this monopod is very disappointing . first of all , you have to ask yourself , why do you need a monopod over a tripod ? for myself and most , it 's because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses . however , telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task . this monopod does n't even come close . here are it 's bad points : -the aluminum construction is very cheap quality . the leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them . it feels like thin , cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time . -the head is very cheap and not solid . no matter how tight i tightened the head , my camera would slope down . the workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point , you think that you 're going to break the plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much . i think we 've all experienced that in the past . -the leg locks are not tight . when you push down on the monopod , the leg segments slide back into themselves . in the end , it was a risk i took hoping that i could get a high-quality product for a cheap price . sometimes , you can get away with that . walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30. in this case , i should 've bought a real monopod . oh well , i wasted $16 that i could 've used to help pay for a higher quality monopod

this film starts with an event based on a true crime . a talk radio show host in denver was killed by an american nazi . ( this event inspired the " talk radio " play and film . ) this film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region . no mention of their economic status ; are they losing dollars and population , small businesses , etc. instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him ! this seems too exaggerated to believe . federal agents are aware of this but do n't want to act yet . their agent is sent back to get more information . there are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas . the film does n't explain what created them . it shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions . no real names , of course . the federal agent meets to report to her higher ups . then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities ( based on real events ) . most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group . ( the fbi put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s . ) this federal agency does n't interfere because they want more information on their aims ( and their leaders ) . more terrorism is planned : dynamiting a courthouse , attacking a power station , etc. the terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day ! kathy finds a secret list of " friends " . this is quickly copied with a camera . the federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them . gary meets with the leader ( who arrives in a helicopter ! ) and shows documents that say kathy is a special investigator . is kathy being served up as a sacrifice ? gary and kathy travel to chicago , where an assassination is planned that will make gary the fall guy . ( another lee harvey oswald ? ) a second " lone gunman " shoots the politician in front of a building . gary fails to shoot , and wo n't ever try this again . costa-gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film " z " . a few years later his film about rebels in south america was popular . his later films have seemed mediocre . a better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does ; better pacing could help . the threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film ( e.g. , timothy mcveigh ) . those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts . a better film today would show the bad results from " nafta " and " free trade " in harming most americans economically . but hollywood would never allow a film about this " war on the middle class " . the word ` nafta ' in greek and arabic refers to ` petroleum' . nafta is a symbol for the policies designed for big oil . it is like george w . bush calling his policy " operation iraqi liberation " .

as a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed city of the living dead and zombie , i was very disappointed with house by the cemetery . fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie , only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes . house by the cemetery is about an researcher ( whose work is never specified ) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress . the titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment , so dr. boyle , his wife lucy and their son bob move in despite a lot of bad signs , like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a dr. jacob tess freudstein in the front hall . bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is ( though no one else sees her ) . furthermore , people keep claiming dr. boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter ( which he denies , not totally convincingly ) . he also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter , anne , who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night . and lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues . got that ? good , because half of that stuff never gets explained . the only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl 's identity and the identity of the killer ( neither of which are that hard to figure out ) . there are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film ( the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand , the photograph that changes with each viewing , a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding ) but fulci 's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints . he lingers too long over some deaths , makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter 's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary . compared to the injury to the eye scene in zombie or christopher george chopping through the coffin in cotld , dr. boyle 's chopping through the door around his son 's head feels like self-parody . fulci 's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot ( the dream-like nature of city of the living dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat ) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic . house by the cemetery has neither thing working in its favor . it 's not hell of the living dead-level bad , but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting ( especially paolo malco , who plays dr. boyle ) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse . also , this version has a " never before seen deleted scene " , but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack

i bought a new state-of-the-art computer in february that came preloaded with windows vista . i was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system , and i hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life . i have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine , especially knowing that had i called dell , they would have installed xp instead . pros : -better security ( it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying " automatic " programs that software makers sneak onto your system ) -better appearance ( this is strictly cosmetic , and i 'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty , useless one ) cons : -freezing : i use this computer 2-3 hours a day and i can expect 1-2 freezes / day . restarting often fails , and i have to cut the power and restart again . -display problems : although the cosmetics of the program were better , vista ca n't display anything right . i tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting . i had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back . apparently , the newest display drivers are incompatible with vista . -incompatibility : entirely too many programs are incompatible with vista , including some fairly big ones ( lots of adobe software , ipods , display drivers , etc. ) i know vista is new , and these software companies are slow to adapt , but does it really make sense for an operating system like vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete ? why ca n't vista play nicely with the other kids ? -its slow ! ! ! - - part of the reason i bought a new , state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop ( which still runs ok , but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years ) . although this computer is light years ahead of the old one , it actually runs even slower than my old laptop . technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of vista . bottom line : 1. if you are not good with computers , avoid vista like the plague 2. vista is a rip-off . save your money and keep / get xp- - i 'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install xp so i can regain some speed and system stability . maybe in the future vista will work ok , but not right now.. . 3. the incompatibility issues- - though there are several- - conspicuously include problems with mac-oriented software ( ipod , adobe ) . i ca n't help but feel that microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle apple

tylenol is an over-the-counter medication that contains as its active ingredient " acetaminophen " . acetaminophen is an analgesic drug that treats mild to moderate pain , making it a great headache reliever , or a medication that treats mild strains , sprains , toothaches , etc. it also acts to reduce fever . acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin . one drawback of acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation ( therefore , it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction ) . it has few side-effects . those with liver disease should avoid acetaminophen , as it is hard on the liver . tylenol ( acetaminophen ) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of reye 's syndrome and aspirin in children . tylenol is the manufacturer 's proprietary name for acetaminophen . there is a generic form of acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter , and this version is much cheaper than " tylenol " , and the container usually contains more tablets / pills , etc. the generic form of acetaminophen is just as effective as tylenol , just cheaper priced . sometimes acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action . for example , tylenol pm has diphenhydramine ( the active ingredient in benadryl ) , which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill . diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine , so it work for itching and allergies too . tylenol is packaged in different strengths : extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet , standard ( 325 mg per tablet ) , and children 's dose of 80 mg . tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version , called " extended release " . rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach , the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract . all in all , acetaminophen is a great product . if you want a " name brand " of acetaminophen , tylenol is your brand ( although it will cost more ) . my choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen . jim " konedog " koenig

i give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer . this movie is not bram stoker 's dracula , but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story . if it was named something else or even kept the name dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name i 'd give it 5 stars . if you want to see the real dracula story first read the actual book by bram stoker , then watch the silent film nosferatu . nosferatu is the only dracula movie that gets the story right . dracula is a monster , he 's not a star crossed lover at all and was n't intended to be . people wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply is n't one . it 's a horror tale , not a vieled porn book , and certainly not a love story . if anything the ones that fail to understand dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him

diana krall 's popularity is not hard to understand , she 's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice - rich , round , and polished . but that 's where the good news ends . the selection of material and the narcoleptic bossa-nova-on-the-rocks arrangements combine to create a cd that is nothing less than a love song to darvon , in fact , inside industry sources maintain that the entire cd was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man . the rule with standards is , do n't do them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair . ms. krall beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly ; cruel and unusual punishment considering it 's a wonder they 're still standing . the resuscitation of popsicle toes is both the final insult and injury , for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle resided in richly deserved obscurity ; how could she do this to us ? wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly inebriated people who are n't listening to each other , much less the ambient audio wallpaper , there will be a demand for music of this type . the diana kralls of the world can always find work because for many - smooth equals good . walk , do n't krall . beyond this woozy , soft-focused world there is music that is real , and really matters .

the first day i took them out to hunt with them they fogged over . i brought them home and there is fog inside . also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens . i called bushnell 's help line and they told me.. . " well , it is n't internally fog proof , just externally " when asked about the stuff on the inside . " that is probably fungus , that sometimes happens " i just bought the binoculars ! ! ! he stated i could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out . avoid these at all costs ! ! ! they are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck

i read several different on-line reviews for this cd before i purchased it . each seemed to imply that this cd was a new direction for jaci , that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature . strange . i must have purchsed the prozac copy of this cd because there is nothing new here from her . like my title line to this review states , it 's the exact same music she has always sang , just in a different package . now the cd just collects dust . what a shame

i was so disappointed in this book . i do n't find a closeness to god in the pages . instead it seems intellectual . it contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with god face to face . even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal god i seek . and though the author 's prayers are included too , i feel the same about them . i expected more from richard j . foster

if you 've found these reviews , you already know this lens is one of the best canon products out there . i did not bite on the is version , and i have not found myself ever wishing i did ; this lens is everything it 's hyped up to be and performs well in low-light / indoor situations . i do n't think it 's weight is that big a deal . i really do n't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day - - in my hands or in a bag - - even with a 1.4 extender attached . it can feel a bit heavy but i do n't mind , and neither will you when you see the results later on . i 've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it 's landed me front page ink several times . in my mind , i could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range , which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography , considering the 300 f / 2.8 and it 's friends are much , much more expensive . the lens works basically just as fast and sharp , in my opinion , with the 1.4 at f / 4 , although some may debate this . flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro . if you can swing the price , enjoy it ! my advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products , although i found most everyone agreed , this is one of the finest lens around . it 's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are

all of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie . this is a very well made movie , with perfectly competent performances . the tone is quite serious , and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up . but then there are many people who loved titanic , which i found utterly depressing . more to the point , though , who cares about the problems of these rich kids ? not me . the real reason to watch this is to see molly ringwald at her most beautiful . and if you enjoy this film , check out less than zero , another gloomy but solid ( & underrated ) ' 80s film . the worst ' 80s film is bright lights , big city - do n't say i did n't warn you !

throb was my introduction to jazz back in ' 69 or ' 70. i have listened to it all of these years on lp then cd , and it never lost its charm . steve swallow was just as nutty then as he is now , " chickens " is my favorite cut . the play between electric violinist richard greene and guitarist jerry hahn is a thing of beauty . hahn is still a player who can put just the right note in just the right place ( like that other countrified genius of jazz bill frisell ) , he can fuzz and wah-wah then tinkle the strings just right to make his musical point . one interesting thing is the organ playing by burton on throb , besides his vibes . the jarrett-burton album also has hahn and swallow , and drummer bill goodwin - -it is very much an album that shows all the new ideas sprouting in music . fortunately , the ideas of that time did not die out , but have continued to grow , making room for all sorts of fusions in jazz , many of which have been remarkable to experience . these two-lps-in-one is like having a superstar album before they became superstars . as i said before , i still play this cd after almost 35 years , and i still get a kick out of it , and still find things that amaze me

one reviewer claims that this is marred by some of eliot 's unfurtunate preducices . but how come you do n't say something like that about o ' henry . we ca n't just stop reading authers because you we do n't like their views . someone calls hemingway looking forward ? if that 's looking forward i'de rather look backward . hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever . most of the people that reviewer named justly loved eliot . eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past , but towards what we have made out of the present . in name of progress , we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls . to call eliot conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous , the first draft according to one of eliot 's biographers , was absolutly a expression of relavtism . one critic accused him being a nihilist . on the poem itself eliot is truly a master at evocating mode and tone , not to mention his brilliant use of imperfect rymthe . so it does n't have the crepty sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler and later poets . so he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard classicism , we could use more of that . yet what he does n't right he evoces through mode and tone , giving us truly one of the best poems of this , or any other century .

i did a little research after trying to install this product and found that symantec is no longer rated very well for anti virus . one site that states this is consumer reports ( they are towards the bottom of the ratings ) . it has become major bloatware and its stability is n't what it used to be . maybe this is why peter norton sold his interests and bailed out . i am far from being a novice , but this thing gave me a fight the whole way . so on with my saga . first , this product was supposed to be for windows xp and 2000 pro . even the box says this . but when i insert the cd in a w2k pro machine all i got was an error box showing the error icon and the ok button . real informative . going through the back door i try to install without going through the cd autostart program . now i get a box that says it requires xp 32 bit . so that leaves out 2 of the machines i bought this for . so i go to a machine running xp . first one loads ok , but it says it is incompatible with my firewall ( zonealarm ) which i happen to trust a lot . then on the second machine it goes through the install ( which takes 45 min ) and then runs the autoupdate and hangs halfway through . i finally had to abort it after it sat there an hour ( i was hoping it was just another slow moment ) . rebooted and the program was no longer running . starting it up myself resulted in it failing to load . now i 'm stuck , it wo n't allow me to uninstall nor reload it again . had to obtain a removal tool from their web site and it promptly removed every symantec product on the machine . maybe this was the writing on the wall ? by now i 'm a couple days into the drama . meanwhile , the first xp machine that loaded fine did another automatic update and guess what . it locked up half way through . now it will not run and had to be removed the same way . so i am now the proud owner of zonealarm 's internet suite . it cost less than the nav ( both 5 user versions ) , and loaded much faster . ten minutes and i was done , where it was an hour into nav when things worked and it loaded . i am taking this up with symantec and trying to get a refund . they can keep it . i 've been less satisfied with every upgrade and this one finally broke the camel 's back . maybe i 'll try again someday if i come up with a new camel , but they do n't grow well in seattle . added 3-12-2007 : i have also noted that after removing nav that things i could not explain before have been cured . for instance , the web site [...] would not load many of it 's pages correctly , they would show the text coding instead of html . now that i am nav free , all of the pages on this site load with no problems . hmmmm. .

i was expecting to see a decent film by bava , but after having seen about 5 of his films , i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us . most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story , this film is just like all the rest . there is no point to any of it , there is no plot and hardly any suspense , suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult , its quite tedious . chris lee is rather banal also , he does n't do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio , most of the cast is rather dull also , supposedly playing some ancient noble family , they look more like 1960 's mop heads and morons who were on too much acid . the dialogue , what there is , is crude , probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes , one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says , " i ca n't have more ice cream ! " so , i would suggest renting " planet of the vampires " because that is more enjoyable than this waste . interesting character to note was " lesmo " , dubbed as the " european peter lorre " who does n't have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget .

you know , after really trying to like this album , i must agree with k johnson . oftentimes a really good album sounds horrible ( or just plain plain ) upon one or three spins , so when this album did n't move me the first time , i decided to hang back and try again in a few days . then again . and again . and one more time . usually after three or four complete spins ( which was like work , with this one ) the jems will work there way to the surface . sufjian stevens was like that . so was z by my morning jacket . but the problem was that i really wanted to like this one . all the reviews i read were hyping this as the album of the decade , and i wanted them to be right . unfortunately , none of them were right . it is a plodding , lifeless album wanting desperately to be ' hip ' and failing miserably , to the point of being embarassing almost . like your 40 something hipster college prof with a graying ponytail ( who will love this , by the way ) , it will be pointless to argue with those who like this album . i have to say that it is obvious these guys put a lot of work into this , and they do have talent ; it just does n't get me there . i hope they can live up to the hype next time . i truly do. .

i rarely write reviews of music but feel that i must share my impressions of this cd . i have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records . i finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers- -lyle lovett - " lungs " ( among others ) and steve earle - " tecumseh valley " . i was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording . other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other townes ' records . i come from a different angle . as someone who has long heard townes sopken of with the highest praise , i can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings . i will also say that i am deeply frustrated that i never took advantage of the chance to see townes perform while he was alive .

when i discovered the existence of this novel , i was enthusiastic and intrigued . unfortunately , my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages . kleopatra focuses on the famous queen 's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family ( something she may have compensated for in adulthood ) . what i liked : 1 ) . the spelling of kleopatra / cleopatra with a " k " - it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection ; 2 ) kleopatra 's strength of character - essex 's general characterization is appropriate and it 's easy to see what kleopatra will become . although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex , it just did n't work for me . the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched . and although i loved kleopatra 's love interest ( i wo n't give away his name ! ) , i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well , almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something . kleopatra 's dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe , as was mohama . there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit.. . unnecessary . overall , although kleopatra was a strong , believable character , she was in the minority . the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt did n't work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction ! at least the sequel is better . for fiction that works , check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george .

over the years at various jobs , i have seen this flashlight several times . it is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse . it may end up looking beat up and yucky , but they always work , no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it . if you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox , work truck , pick-up glove compartment , etc. , this is the only one you need . if you need a good flashlight at home , and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store , this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy . i finally bought one just for my home , and i am only sorry i did not do this years ago ( i am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox ; i refuse to replace it ) . i like this version because it has a strong magnet , and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck . i also like that it has switch guards , so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath 25# of stuff in your toolbox . one nit-picky complaint . it has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector . however , it comes empty and you have to supply your own , so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight .

i read the book and saw the movie , which other than title and major characters , have little in common . i ca n't say i really liked either . the book is a little funnier . my major learning from the whole project was when " who wants to be a millionaire " taught me about " roman a clefs " , of which " devil " is one . perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry , i 'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that " devil " provides . meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly , editor-in-chief of runway magazine , but somehow she 's never quite devil enough . anne hathaway is passable in her second ( or third ) " made over princess " role . the minor characters , including the wonderful tracie thoms as " best friend " lily , are mostly wasted .

this is tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures . and it takes wonderful video . the downloading is easy and in general it 's a " fine " camera . however... . the flash on it is nothing short of a nightmare . it 's constantly over exposing every subject . i find it practically un-usable . the only way i can get the image i 'm looking for in a lower light setting is to set the iso to 800. if it had a 1600 iso i would n't need the flash at all practically but it does n't offer that . the other thing i do n't like that i did n't realize i would n't like is that it does n't have it 's own cradle in which to charge the batteries . the batteries have to be removed and charged seperately . does n't sound like a big deal but it is a pain when you think about it . the batteries lose their charge even when the camera is n't on which results in picking up the camera after 2 days and realizing it has no juice . intensely dissatisfying . this camera also has a really long delay from pushing the button to taking the picture . this results in lots of closed eyes and stupid faces . i know that most digitals have a delay but this one is epic . i am getting ready to sell this camera and buy a canon . i am a wedding photographer and shoot mostly with my canon 5d . but since this was rated camera of the year by american photo ( a publication i trust implicitly ) , i decided to stray from my canon . bad idea . i 'm going right to a powershot . do not pass go . do not collect $200. i reccommend you do the same .

i must say i enjoyed the book , but the ending was so sudden , with so many things left hanging , that i was disappointed . i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up - how did manderly catch fire , what did they do when they got to the burning house , and how did they pick up their lives . all we had at the ending was ashes . also , the narrator , who never gives her name , was sometimes very odd - hiding behind doors in her own home , sneaking food , hiding behind chairs . the book is worth reading , but i wish that , instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea , du maurier had written a better ending .

i use adobe acrobat professional extensively both as an attorney and as a researcher / author . because of the new features advertised which would enhance acrobat storage of powerpoint presentations , i bought it off the shelves at a local staples office supply dealer . i am proficient at my own installations and expected no trouble on this . it acted like a virus . the program did not finish installing . worse yet , it corrupted the underlying 7.0 installation and fixed that so the windows controller program could not install it . i had to hack through the registry to remove traces of it . finally i got to a stage where it appeared to be going through the registry process again . then i received the coup de grace - - a bad serial number message . i checked carefully and it matched the serial number exactly as on the label sent by adobe inside its factory package . i used microsoft onenote to make a colored screen copy of this phenonema and marched the package back to staples where they refunded my money . it 's too bad about the 20 plus billable hours as a lawyer lost to this process . my experiences in calling adobe in the past when i puzzled through a far lesser discourage me from wanting to talk to their technical support people ( who too often know less than me given the increasingly apparent out-sourcing to people who read from a script and give us credit for knowing far less than we do ) . at any rate , i am now bitter . my 7.08 installation of adobe worked great on my favorite computer where i had the bulk of my multimedia presentations which i hoped to reduce complete with sounds to the adobe 8.0 format . i suspect that wrong serial numbers were slapped on the packages . i am deeply disappointed , even angry at the inconvenience this has caused me . i took it home and tried it on my desktop there and it also would not complete the installation and ruined my chances of a clean uninstallation of 7.0. deactivation of 7.0 could not take place either after installation of 8.0. i do n't know what adobe was thinking - - or if they were thinking . i have been a loyal customer of theirs for many years , but i 'm thinking distinctly non-charitable thoughts about them this early morning . i hope they get their act together - - soon . they owe us all a quick fix and patch and they need deep repentance for the damage this did to windows xp home installations which also appear to be corrupted in the process of installing this " upgrade " program which acts more like a computer worm or virus than a program

" boa " ( also known as " new alcatraz " ) actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness , which i do n't think was a smart idea . the technical team - photography , production design-set decoration , etc. - create a fairly effective , chilling atmosphere , but everything else about " boa " is strictly routine . dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable , although elizabeth lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife , and the supporting cast ( mark sheppard , grand l . bush , craig wasson ) is just a touch more professional . the film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we ca n't see just how fake it looks . i do n't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with ; other , similar titles include " python " 1 and 2 , " anaconda " ( the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997 ) and " anaconda : search for the blood orchid " , and the inevitable " boa vs. python " . the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors . 2 /

i received " aerial " last december , and it still amazes me . the music soars and sweeps , carrying the listener along on its wings . it is a work of genius , and those who are long-time kate bush fans will find that it was well worth waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive ! this two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences , in my opinion . the first disc , " a sea of honey " is comprised of sort of stand alone pieces , first of which is " king of the mountain , " probably the most " commercially appealing " song on the album . " king of the mountain " sucks the listener in with deep , murky tones and kate 's voice easing into the song softly , building in intensity as the song progresses . " king of the mountain " is followed by songs like " pi " ( who else but kate bush could make the derivation of pi sound so sexy ? ) and " bertie , " a lovely elizabethan paean to her young son . then there are emotionally raw songs like " mrs. bartolozzi " and " a coral room , " the latter of which is about kate 's late mother . the reclusive ms. bush teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in " how to be invisible , " and sings in reference to joan of arc in " joanni . " after being captivated by songs about famous people , and more down-to-earth personal struggles / triumphs , the listener comes to the second disc , titled " a sky of honey . " this is , in my opinion , the piï¿½ce de rï¿½sistance of " aerial . " this disc is a continuous journey of sound , taking the listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by- -among other things- -the sounds of birds , the sound of her child 's voice , and kate bush 's silky voice singing in italian . the disc is almost indescribably beautiful , in my opinion . i love the way " a sky of honey " takes me out of myself when i hear it . i feel like i am flying at points ; becoming one with the soaring birds . my personal favorite on " a sky of honey " is " nocturn , " a surreal nighttime romp on the beach , accompanied by thumping bass and showcasing the pure magic of kate bush 's voice . the disc 's final ( and title ) track " aerial " is a forceful climax to the sonic journey , and ends with bush singing : " i want to be up on the roof i 've gotta be up on the roof up , up high on the roof up , up on the roof in the sun " it is as though kate bush has reached new heights and has taken the listener along for the trip . what an absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is ! to kate bush fans , i cannot recommend this album highly enough . true , it was a very long wait for this new cd , but , ms. bush has rewarded her fans duly ; indeed it is almost like she released two separate albums at once with this two-disc triumph ! if you are a kate bush devotee , you will not be disappointed ! and , if you are new to kate bush , " aerial " will be a great introduction to her genius . kate bush is like no other artist i can name . her voice is incredibly versatile ; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a banshee , a temptress or a child . and , so far in her career , it kate bush 's voice gets better with the passing of time . like a fine wine , one can savor it and contemplate its complexities endlessly . " aerial " is well , well worth listening to , and words alone cannot suffice to explain what a work of art it is .

afi finally release a live dvd , and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now , it is very impressive . it does lack older , more hardcore punk tracks , but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the band it is now . each album progresses towards more epic scales , and songs balance beauty with power . " i heard a voice " captures this on film , and the fan gets to witness afi at their most grandiose . watching vocalist davey havok sing " god called in sick today " while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime . the masterful command of theatrics from each member , especially havok , creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate . the setlist itself is perfectly put together , with the only gripe being the exclusion of " kiss and control . " the rest of the songs display all facets of afi , from the fast paced " dancing through sunday " , ( which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist jade puget ) " kill caustic " , " death of seasons " , " totalimmortal " and " a single second " , ( the last of which features a guest appearance by nick 13 of tiger army ) to the slower paced " this time imperfect " and " endlessly , she said " as well as all of their recent singles , and a few more cuts from their latest releases " decemberunderground " and " sing the sorrow " . extras are geared towards the fans , with despair faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the decemberunderground release , as well as a poster . each band member has their moments to shine , and are all very capable and talented muscians . bassist hunter burgan and drummer adam carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals , as puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery , in this genre , over the instrument . this is all built up to allow havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes , mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice , to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you . the quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic . unlike other live dvd 's , where the concert is edited to the point of a music video , " i heard a voice " has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd , but also add to the overall effect of the performance . the sound is very clear , and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix . this is overall a very stellar production , and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band , as well as new fans and casual fans , should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy

i recently purchased the obus forme lowback backrest , along with the seat cushion . although i have heard people rave about the excellent support , and they felt comfortable enough to me , i ca n't give them more than 2 stars . the material used in their construction drove me to distraction . this is obviously a personal preference type of thing . other folks may have no issues with the material at all . these are just my feelings on the matter : i found the texture of the fabric to be a little rough and it did n't allow easy movement when sitting on / leaning against it , which would drive me crazy after just a few hours at work . also , when making any movements , the compression of the foam , and the friction between it and the fabric covering , made really annoying noises . it reminded me somewhat of snow compressing down when walking on it . the backrest was even worse than the seat cushion because it had a thin plastic wrapping ( looked sort of like shrink wrap or saran wrap ) around the foam inside , which made loud crinkling noises every time i even twitched . it was awful ! however good the science behind the backrest and cushion is , the sound effects and unpleasant texture were distracting enough , to me at least , to return both items .

impressed with the way it clears out viruses , spyware , and trojans- --i can look at what it 's doing or just let it do it . that all goes well . what i do n't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign-me-in sites and i ca n't figure how to change this . so the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful

i am absolutely furious about this book . i quit reading about half-way through . i read it through the section about it 's a wonderful life ( chapter 13 ) . in that chapter , i found three mistakes - not minor details , but major , provable points , including misquoting zuzu and misquoting the inscription in the book in the last scene - within four paragraphs . if eliot 's work is that shoddy in four paragraphs , how can i trust the rest of the information in the book ? avoid this at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

i 'm not sure what compelled me to seek out " americano , " written and directed by kevin noland . it 's not as if i was dying to check up on the career of joshua jackson , a star of tv 's " dawson 's creek . " perhaps i was intrigued by dennis hopper 's inclusion in such a small scale production- -i mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar . here , however , the lure for him seems to have been his daughter ruthanna , who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film . maybe it was international star leonor varela , a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in america . most likely , though , it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of spain . with great scenery , bull fights , hemingway , hard drinking and partying , the running of the bulls- -the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing . however , i am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film . i think noland has talent and i look forward to other works . the film is photographed well and has good performances . my problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming-of-age story . with an astounding lack of real character insight , this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat . the setup is simple . as recent college graduates , jackson and two pals ( who bicker comically ) are spending the last few days of their vacation in spain before jackson must return to the " real " world and a new job . facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood , work and independence , freedom and monotony , dreams and reality- -jackson falls into lust with a local played by varela . should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance ? should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure ? should he stay in spain ? these are legitimate questions and a legitimate , albeit familiar , story path . what makes " americano " so tedious and uninvolving , however , is that the film does n't allow you to know its characters . a character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off- -and " americano " does n't succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation . we never know anything about jackson 's job or life in america , or his dreams , passions , interests , etc...aside from this fleeting romance . sure , the film goes through the requisite motions- -jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of hemingway , what else would you expect in spain ? if he has artistic aspirations , however , the screenplay surely never develops this . lacking any real guidance as to what jackson envisions for his life , i simply fell into the camp of " who cares ? " there are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of spanish culture . dennis hopper 's role , however , as a club host is a complete misfire . ultimately , though , my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth . sure , jackson 's at a crossroads- -but lacking any understanding of what he wants , it made no difference to me what he chose . sorry , but that 's a big problem when it is your film 's central theme . kgharris , 02 / 07

this flash is the perfect back-up for a studio , or main / flash fill for an amateur studio . i use several w / slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of dollars . i like that they are light and easy to pack and transport . they are reasonably priced . they have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles . the sunpak has auto / f-stop and manual . if you are a real photographer , you will know how to use them . the down side is that if your sunpak is plugged into a wall , it takes far too long to recharge ( sometimes 3-5 seconds ) . rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes .

the pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell - - what are these " packaging engineers " thinking ? it took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it , and then i took the scissors to it , and the hard packaging almost broke them ! but i was thrilled . a handsome object , thought i , and i loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open . so much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband . i yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed . but , alas , it would not follow instructions as they were written . " press and hold the set button . hour display blinking . " ( could they not have said , " the hour display will blink " ? i pressed . " press memory button to adjust the hour . " i did . the memory button never did a thing . so i asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either . we both tried several combinations of maneuvers , but nothing worked . to this moment , the hour display is blinking , blinking , blinking . i 'd like to get my money back , but ya know what ? j & r music & computer world in ny demand such a rigamarole to send it back , including with all the original packaging ( i threw the op in the trash ) , that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions , which , of course , are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves . now i 'm afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash , while i will make sure i never order from j&r again .
